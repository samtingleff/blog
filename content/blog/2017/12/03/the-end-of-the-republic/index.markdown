I find it difficult to see this GOP tax bill pass and not become incredibly pessimistic about this country's future. [Deeply unpopular Congress aims to pass deeply unpopular bill for deeply unpopular president to sign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/29/deeply-unpopular-congress-aims-to-pass-deeply-unpopular-bill-for-deeply-unpopular-president-to-sign/) says it all.

We have an extremist minority party serving a voting constituency of [all of about 10 people](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/a-guide-to-the-billionaires-bankrolling-the-gop-candidates/391233/). Whether we are descending into authoritarianism, kleptocracy, oligarchy, or whatever... clearly the situation we find ourselves in is one of taxation without representation.

One wonders if the voters who put these assholes in power - ignore Trump for the moment - are getting what they want.

And still, this tax bill on the face of it does not make a lot of sense politically. At most 30% of Americans like it. Yet some senators have been remarkably honest about whom it is intended to serve.

The only rational explanation which makes sense to me is this one.

It's an interesting - and terrible - situation. The pessimistic case is that they are true believers of supply side economics as the one true religion of the GOP. And perhaps that's true for some members of the party.

The optimistic case is that the GOP is fucked, knows it, and will not win another legitimate election for 20 years. The tax "reform" bill is a last gasp F-U to America in an attempt to preserve their own wealth and their donor's wealth for generations.
