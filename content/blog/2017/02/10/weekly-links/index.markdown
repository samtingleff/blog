Imagine three possible worlds:

1. Trump loses the election (well, the Electoral College one) and launches a cable network to spout alternative facts and propaganda 24/7.
2. Trump is impeached and Pence takes the reigns.
3. Trump miraculously holds on to the presidency for four years, frustrated at every step by the courts and a majority of the country.

As ridiculous as it sounds (3) is perhaps the best outcome of all. It's forced the country to understand the GOP for what it is - an extremist minority religious group with four basic goals: environmental destruction; tax cuts, deregulation and other welfare for the wealthy; and a populace so afraid of terrorism that we welcome a police state.

If Pence takes over, the GOP returns to Republican-ism as usual, hiding the agenda behind far more mainstream bullshit than Trump appears capable of doing. Trump's "drain the swamp" turns out to mean taking Republican politics to it's nadir, which is a helpful exercise for the rest of us to understand the real objectives.
