The Mobile Solution is a San Diego company that operates those cell phone retail stores you see in malls these days. They resell phones and service from T-Mobile and AT&amp;T Wireless.

Those of you smarter than I would find the previous two sentences sufficient reason to stay away.

B and I recently went through one of their stores to sign up for a T-Mobile family plan (cause we're a family now) and buy her a new phone. Suffice it to say that service from Mobile Solution totally sucks and we will never use them again.

We suggest that you do the same.
