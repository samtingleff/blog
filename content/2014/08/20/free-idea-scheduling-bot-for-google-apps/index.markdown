My employer cannot be the only organization full of busy individuals having difficulty scheduling meetings with each other.

I dream of an instant messenger bot which could schedule meetings on my behalf. It would have access to everybody's google calendar and could negotiate independently with everybody to find working times.

> sam: please schedule a 30 minute meeting next week with Sarah, Steve and Brian
> bot: sure thing! what should I call it?
> sam: project hog wild
> bot: thanks!

The bot would then take a look at calendars for myself, Sarah, Steve and Brian, and choose times with the least conflicts.

If unable to find a time without conflicts, it would begin to negotiate with each individual:

> bot: sarah, would you be able to attend a meeting with Sam/Steve/Brian on Tuesday at 3pm?
> sarah: I'm not sure, how important is it?
> bot: it's about project hog wild, are you familiar with that?
> sarah: okay, I can reschedule
> bot: great! thank you

And we're done! We'd be first in line to pay for such a thing.
