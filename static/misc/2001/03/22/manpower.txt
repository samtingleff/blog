They tell me at SAIC that you declined thier offer?  
What are you thinking?  What are you doing right now
that is so creative?  If your waiting for more .com
work forget it. I've noted your response on our
system.  I didn't think you would answer my phone
call due to your lack of integrity anyway.  
Good luck.
