<font size=+2><b>How to Change or Declare Your Major</b></font>

<p>
<blockquote>
The form to change or declare the major is obtained at the Registrar's office.<br>
The form is titled, "Undergraduate Change of Major Request", it's a single page<br>
document, easy to complete and does not require the department's approval.

<p>
Only declared majors may telephone register into Communication courses. If<br>
you haven't declared and telephone enrollment (TeSS) is about to begin or in<br>
progress, go to the Registrar's and complete the form. As you submit the form<br>
let them know you wish to have the 'hold' lifted so you may TeSS immediately.<br>
The form will be processed promptly allowing you to TeSS instantly, otherwise,<br>
you will not be cleared to TeSS until the following pre-enrollment period.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size=+2><b>Enrollment Procedure</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Telephone enrollment (TeSS)

<ol>
	<li>Call the TeSS phone number: 534-4000 (TDD 822-1699)<br>
(If using an on-campus Ericsson digital phone, press the Dial<br>
Additional Digits button before entering your Personal ID number.)

	<li>Enter your Personal ID Number.

	<li>Enter your Personal Access Code.

	<li>When prompted, enter your first Section ID and wait for<br>
a response. If the course has multiple grading options or<br>
variable units, the system will prompt you to enter your<br>
choice at the appropriate time.
</ol>

<p>
Most Communication courses are set up on the computer<br>
to recognize only Communication declared majors who have<br>
completed the prerequisites. If not qualified, permission<br>
from the instructor and a department stamp will allow you<br>
to enroll.

<p>
<li>Enroll in your classes via <a href="https://www-act.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/studentlink.pl/1/">WebReg</a>

<p>
By using your Student ID number and PAC (the same ones<br>
you use for telephone enrollment) you can add, drop, change,<br>
and wait list sections on-line.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+2><b>To Add a Course</b></font>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Attend the course you wish to add and get the professor's permission and<br>
have him/her sign an add/drop card. If the class you wish to add is a course with<br>
sections/discussions you need the TA's signature instead of the professor's.
	<li>Bring the card to the main office for a department stamp.
	<li>Submit it to the Registrar's.<br>
The Registrar's will not process your add card without the department stamp.<br>
Also, if you happened to get the professor's signature before classes begin, save<br>
the card. The department will not issue a stamp until classes begin. If you take<br>
the card to the Registrar's before classes begin without a department stamp, the<br>
card will be taken from you and thrown away. Save your card and do not worry,<br>
the signature secures you a place in class until you can properly enroll.
</ol>


<p>
<font size=+2><b>How to Obtain Grades</b></font>

<blockquote>
<p>
The department does not list nor give grades by telephone or otherwise. Grades<br>
are available on TeSS approximately two weeks after the end of final week for<br>
the term. Check the Calendar in the front of the Schedule of Classes for the<br>
projected date. Contact the department regarding unreported grades. Unreported<br>
grades will lapse to failing if not cleared within one quarter.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size=+2><b>How to Contest a Grade</b></font>
<blockquote>
<p>
Speak to the professor or Teacher Assistant who issued the grade. If it isn't<br>
resolved to your satisfaction refer to the UCSD general catalog for detailed<br>
information on how to proceed.
