<p>
The UCSD Department of Communication contains a large amount of valuable 
reference information and links.  This information however, neglects the 
needs of undergraduates.  The site could be used as a source of 
department and research information relevant 
to undergraduates.  The department would need to increase awareness of 
the site - both inside and outside the UCSD community.

<p>
For the Communication site to expand in its purpose and maintain 
relevance to all, it should be decentralized.  Bruce Jones cannot be 
expected to design, produce, edit, and maintain all past and future 
pages.  His role should be changed to one of supervision for the
 variety of faculty, staff, graduates, and undergraduates wishing to 
publish.  Through the use of CGI scripts and general publishing 
mechanisisms students would have a greater voice.

<p>
Any redesign of the Communication Department site should account for the 
needs of undergraduates.  A new site should allow for student input 
through several mechanisms:  a shared library of external links, a <a 
href="forum.html">class forum</a>, and <a 
href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/undergrads.html">general publishing</a>.  Undergraduates should 
be polled for input and informed (most are not opposed to email from the 
department) about possible changes to the site.  The most important 
factor to consider in a redesign is the input of students themselves.  
Their needs should guide the site structure, design, and content.

<p>
A successful site redesign would model the successful architecture of <a
href="http://studentlink.ucsd.edu">Studenlink</a> and <a
href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/ugis/masscomm/">Mass Communications</a> at
Berkeley.  It would have the high-quality content of the UCSD <a
href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/">CSE</a> and <a
href="http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science</a> Departments.  A
successful design would borrow from the <a
href="http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/lit/">Literature</a> (without
the annoying status bar message) and <a
href="http://math.ucsd.edu/">Math</a> Departments.  Publishing on
the web is always a balance.  The challenge for the Communication
Department is to meet the diverse needs of faculty, staff, graduates,
undergraduates, and prospective students.  In order to meet those needs, 
they must all be involved in the process.
