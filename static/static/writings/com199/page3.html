A total of 17 people in Carol Padden's senior seminar class responded to the survey.  13 of them had seen the department web page, and visit it an average of five times per quarter.  A specific class syllubus was cited 13 times as the reason for the visit




.  Five students said that they were looking for information on a professor.  Three students said that they were looking for a "schedule."

<p>
Students wanted to see a variety of major-related information not currently available on the communication web server.

<p>
Some of the suggestions were for information available from other UCSD sources:
<ul>
<li>Major requirements and class descriptions (<a href="http://www-dur.ucsd.edu/generalcatalog/Communication/default.htm">General Catalog</a>)
<li>Finals schedule and changes to the class schedule (<a href="http://studentlink.ucsd.edu/">Studentlink</a>).
</ul>

Several students wanted information available on the web, but not through UCSD:
<ul>
<li>Career opportunities in communication (<a href="http://www.ukans.edu/~upc/maj_coms.html">University of Kansas</a>,<a href="http://www.utc.edu/commdept/careers.html">University of Tennessee at Chatanooga</a>)
<li>Graduate schools in communication (<a 
href="http://www.natcom.org/ComProg/gpdhtm/gpindex.htm">National 
Communication Association</a>, <a 
href="http://cotton.uamont.edu/~scauso/gradprog.html">National 
Communication Association Undergraduate Student Organizations</a>, <a 
href="http://www.gradschools.com/">GradSchools.com</a>). </ul>
The rest of the suggestions were for information not currently available anywhere on the web:  
<ul>
<li>Year-long Communication undergraduate class schedule
<li>Information about independent/group study in Communication.
</ul>
