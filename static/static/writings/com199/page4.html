Responses to the survey indicated a general lack of interest in the 
department page.  Undergraduates do not think of it as a source of 
valuable information, except for specific class syllabii.  A <a 
href="example.html">typical response</a> illustrates this.  The 
department web page could be a source of information important to 
communication undergraduates - class descriptions/schedules, major 
requirements, career opportunities, etc.

<p>
There is a whole range of information that could be distributed on the 
Communication Department page.  One student expressed dissapointment that 
"so few classes and professors actually have their office hours, course 
outlines or email addresses posted on the Web."  The web could be a 
convienent source of this basic information, for undergraduates and 
prospective students.  Besides her suggestions, this would include:
<ul>
<li>A Communication course catalog
<li>Special Programs in Communication<br>
	(Independent/Group study, Honors Program, Education Abroad)
<li>Requirements for the Communication major/minor
<li>Career paths for Communication majors
<li>Enrollment procedures
<li>Graduate school advice and links.

</ul>

<p>
I've prepared a quick <a href="sample.html">sample</a> 
of what an undergraduate index might look like.
