The top level links on the index page could be categorized and reduced to a simpler interface.  Students are confused by 17 links that are all given equal weight.  The information architecture of the site should be changed to allow easy navigation from th
e first page to desired information.  The undergraduate looking for an on-line political forum may not bother to read through 16 lines of text to find "The Apropos Page" or the "Burn! Collective," but s/he will quickly recognize "Political Forums."

<p>
The most confusing aspect of the index page is that the 17 links are not hierarchically organized.  Web surfers have come to expect fewer categories on pages acting as launch points.  The six pages with the most on-campus hits during November 1998 (beside
s the index) were:
<p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/Undergrad.Classes/HIP111A.F98/syllabus.html">Syllabus</a> for Com/MT 111A (198 hits)
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/courses/index.html">Current class syllabii</a> (118)
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/index.html">The People</a> (71)
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/intro/index.html">The Program</a> (60)
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/MCA/">Mind, Culture, and Activity</a> Homepage (51)
<li><a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/faculty.html">Faculty biographies</a> (40)
</ol>

<p>
These pages are all relatively easy to access from the index page.  Yet they have equal weight as the <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/courses/142sched.html">Sequoyah 142 Schedule</a> (6 hits), <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/resources/index.html">Local Resources</a> (3), and <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/resources/weblinks.html">I
nformation Services on the Web</a> (2).  These links do not belong on the opening communication.ucsd.edu page.  Following the <a href="http://studentlink.ucsd.edu">Studenlink</a> model, the opening page should present a small set of categories leading to 
more detail.  This categorization is not easy, but it can be done.
