<p>
Students in Communication have traditionally looked toward radio, 
television and journalism for
career opportunities. With the ever-increasing accessibility of video 
and computer technologies
and a tendency for businesses and non-profit groups to handle their own 
public relations and in-
house educational programs; we suggest that individuals with an 
imagination can apply their skills
in writing, speaking, research, video and computers to find a broad 
range of career opportunities
beyond the mass media. These individuals should look towards industry, 
the public utilities,
government agencies, medical and educational institutions, as areas that 
are expanding their
facilities and operations to include communication related services.

<p>
Industry, with its move toward developing employee training programs, 
needs people who can
both design and teach courses for them and write the texts used. In 
addition, businesses such as
aerodynamics firms, computer companies, banks and machinery manufacturers 
have incorporated
the use of video training into their educational divisions and 
instructional packages.

<p>
Political representatives and government agencies seek staff members who 
not only can do
substantial independent research but who can draft legal proposals, 
respond to public inquiries,
operate video equipment, etc. Educational facilities need individuals 
with strong research abilities
and good verbal skills to conduct surveys and analyses that can go 
toward the development of new curricula in a variety of areas.

<p>
Hospitals and other medical facilities often have their own public 
affairs divisions which may do
anything from graphic design for brochures to promoting community 
education programs. In
addition the photographing of tissue samples, the use of video in 
physical therapy, the taping of
seminars, and the production of public service announcements are but a 
few examples of the application of media in the medical arena.

<p>
Actual job titles of recent graduates of UCSD's Communication Department 
reveal an even more
diverse range of career choices, many not directly related to the major. 
For a complete listing of
entry-level jobs held by UCSD graduates for the past three years, see 
the Career Survey in the Reference Room of the <a 
href="http://www-csc.ucsd.edu/">Career Services Center</a>.

<p>
Talking to professionals working in various fields can be helpful in 
choosing between the various
career options. Binders of "career consultants" at the Career Services 
Center contain names of
alumni and other professionals from a variety of occupational fields who 
have applied their
Communication major in the work force and are willing to talk to 
students about their jobs.

<p>
These contacts can also be good sources of information when students are 
ready to begin their job
search. As stated earlier in this handbook, establishing a network of 
personal contacts is the most
effective job hunting method in the highly competitive communications 
field. Employers don't
advertise extensively or recruit on campus. Most jobs are filled by word 
of mouth because of the
abundance of professionals looking for work in the field. Doing an 
internship through the
<a href="http://aip.ucsd.edu/">Academic Internship Program</a> is another 
way of gaining 
practical work experience which could lead to permanent employment.

<p>
The Career Services Center's "Job Search Handbook" is filled with job 
search strategies. It shows
how to start with friends and acquaintances and build them into an 
extensive network of contacts.
The Mentor program goes a step further by providing students with an 
initial contact, pairing them
with a professional in the community to help them begin their job search.

<p>
An advanced degree expands the career opportunities for Communication 
majors even more.
Previous graduates of the department have gone to law school or business 
school, while others
have taken advanced studies in cinema or journalism. Some pursue a Ph.D. 
for eventual careers in university teaching and research.

<p>
Successful applicants to graduate and professional schools follow two 
crucial pieces of advice:
<ol>
	<li>They conduct independent research on topics of interest under the 
guidance of faculty who can later
write them letters of recommendation.
	<li>They research many schools 
and programs to find the
ones whose requirements match their qualifications.
</ol>

<p>
Professional and graduate school advisors at the Career Services Center 
can explain the admissions
process more thoroughly and recommend a timetable to follow to maximize 
preparation. A
comprehensive reference area in the Center houses catalogs and other 
information on specific
programs, admissions manuals, financial aid and fellowship information, 
and test preparation materials.
