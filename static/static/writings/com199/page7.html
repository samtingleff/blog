Several Communication departments across the country organize their pages into separate graduate and undergraduate areas (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/communication/">Stanford</a>, <a href="http://www.comm.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a>, <a href="http


://ucaswww.mcm.uc.edu/communication/welcome.htm">University of Cincinnati</a>).  The UCSD Department of Communication, however, is not segregated in this manner.  Graduates and undergraduates share the same faculty, resources, and areas of study.  Thus, t


his is not an appropriate distinction for the department web site.

<p>
An appropriate category for the Communication Department site is "The Program."  This already exists, but it could be expanded to include "<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/people">The People</a>" and "<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/publications/">Department News and Publications</a>."

<p>
Another categorization can be made of "Resources in Communication."  This would include:
<ul>
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/commresources.html">Web Resources in Comm</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/onlinejournals.html">On-Line Journals and Newsletters</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/resources/weblinks.html">Information Services on the Web</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/localresources.html">Local UCSD Resources</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/searcheng.html">WWW Search Engines</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/techlinks.html">WWW Technology Links</a>"
<li>"<a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Unix.docs/index.html">BJ's Unix Primer</a>."
</ul>

<p>
Joshua Polterock suggests "a shared library of categorized external links relevant to the department."  This would incorporate many of the above pages into a single index of external research links relevant to communication at UCSD.  Faculty, staff, graduates, and undergraduates would be able to submit new sites.  Submissions could be moderated for relevance.  This could be modeled off of Josh's <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/surf/">Surfer Resources</a> page.

<p>
The remaining links could be similarly organized into larger categories.  
The UC Berkeley <a
href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/ugis/masscomm/">Department of Mass 
Communications</a> provides an excellent model for this process.  I've 
prepared a quick <a href="newindex.html">model</a> of the resulting 
page.  The design itself is not as important here as the structure of the 
information behind it.
