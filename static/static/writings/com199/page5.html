Another conclusion to be made from the survey is that many undergraduates 
find the department page difficult to navigate.  One student said that other campus sites are useful because "they give information faster," they are "easier to 
browse," and they are "accessible."  Computer semi-literate students may 
find the interface intimidating and difficult to use.  The <a 
href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/">index page</a> presents a list of 
links - many of which are irrelevant to undergraduates (if not 
most everyone) - in a form that cannot be quickly searched and navigated.  The hierarchy of information is unclear upon first glance.

<p>
One student told me he would like to see "a forum to discuss (the) latest issues."  Although not entirely interactive (an interactive on-line forum could easily be added), the <a href="http://communication.ucsd.edu/apropos/">Apropos Page</a> and the <a hr

ef="http://burn.ucsd.edu/">Burn!</a> collective <i>are</i> discussions of the latest issues.  This student could not easily find these pages and recognize their purpose.  Allowing readers to post messages on the Apropos Page would solve another problem - 

keeping it current.  Undergraduates have difficulty navigating the site to find desired information.

<p>
There are several campus web sites students frequently cited as useful:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://studentlink.ucsd.edu">Studentlink</a>
<li><a href="http://sshl.ucsd.edu/">Social Science and Humanities Library</a>
<li><a href="http://roger.ucsd.edu/">Roger</a> and <a
 href="http://www.melvyl.ucop.edu/">Melvyl</a>
<li><a href="http://www-csc.ucsd.edu/">Career Services</a>
</ul>

Students complemented these for their ease of use and easy access to valuable  information.  Studentlink was often cited for its convienent interface.  Unlike the Communication site, Studentlink presents a short list of links.  They are clear and easy to 

read.  The student looking to add a class quickly knows to click on "Web Reg."  The Communication department site should have the same quality.
