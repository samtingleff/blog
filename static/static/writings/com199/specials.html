<h2><center><a name="HONORS">Honors Program</a></center></h2>
The communication Department Honors Program is designed for seniors who wish to undertake an extended research or creative production project under supervision of a Communication faculty member.  Because the Honors program requires a two-quarter sequence of courses and classes are generally smaller, students get an opportunity to work at length with faculty and other students on an individual project.  Students who have special interests and plan to go on to graduate school, or plan to work in fields of production are strongly recommended to apply to the Honors program.

<p>
Applications to the Honors Program must be made the spring before student is at senior standing.  Requirements for the program include:

<p>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>Support from a faculty member
		<li>Overall GPA of at least 3.0
		<li>Major GPA of at least 3.5
		<li>Brief description of the proposed research or creative production
	</ul>

<p>
A faculty committee will review applications and accept students with promising projects.  Students who do not meet these criteria may be admitted by special dispensation of the Committee.

<p>
Once accepted into the Honors Program, students are required to complete a two-quarter sequence, COGN 191A and COGN 191B in the Fall and Winter quarters of their senior year.  At the end of COGN 191A, the student receives an IP or "In Progress" grade.  The IP grade changes to a letter grade at the completion of the second course, COGN 191B.  The letter grade will be based on attendance in the seminars and successful completion of a research or creative production project.  The project is then sent to a faculty committee for review and evaluation of a department Honors award designation on the diploma.

<p>
Successful completion of the Honors Program enables the student to graduate "With Highest Distinction," "With High Distinction," or "With Distinction," depending on performance in the program.

<h2><center><a name="EAP">Education Abroad Program EAP and the Opportunities Abroad Program OAP</a></center></h2>

<p>
Communication students are encouraged to participate in the <!-- Find a link here -->Education Abroad Program (EAP).  The program offers undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to integrate into the academic and social life of select foreign universities while continuing to work in major fields of study or otherwise fulfilling UC requirements.

<p>
EAP provides students access to distinguished academic programs that complement those of the UC campuses and where students can make normal progress toward their degrees at a cost as close as possible to that of education on a UC campus.  EAP helps students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to function confidently and compete successfully in our global environment.

<p>
The program stimulates the intellectual development of the participants, broadening the general education of all, and giving a new depth to the particular academic interests of some.  Most gain fluency in a language other than their own, and all grow in their ability to engage in independent study.  Perhaps most valuable of all are increased self-understanding, clarified life purposes, and a broadening and deepening of personal values.  The qualities gained enhance resumes and applications for advanced degrees.

<p>
EAP courses will be considered UC credit; course titles, units and grades will appear on your transcript.  <!-- Find a link here -->OAP Opportunities Abroad Program courses, if approved will be considered as transfer credit.  OAP course titles and units but not grades will appear on your UCSD transcript.  The UCSD Admissions Office determines initial transfer-ability of unit credit for OAP.

<p>
In the case of both programs, units will automatically count towards your degree but major/minor/GE requirements must be approved and petitioned separately.  The academic departments and colleges determine whether you can satisfy these requirements through course work completed abroad.

<p>
Students requesting credit for upper division classes must submit the student petition outlining the request and they must attach a description of the class, a syllabus and a list of books and readings for the class.  No class will be considered without the attending material.  Final disposition of your petition should be obtained from your college advising office in three weeks.

<p>
<b>Only one petition for either an AIP 197 or COGN 198 or 199 will be accepted to the major.  Please see the Catalog for university policy on Pass/No Pass classes applied to the major.</b>

<h2><a name="AIP">Academic Internship Program and University of California and Washington, D.C. Program</a></h2>

<p>
Communication students are encouraged to participate in the <!-- Find a link here -->Academic Internship Program offered
by Warren College. The Academic Internship Program (AIP) offers qualified juniors and seniors
the opportunity to acquire valuable work experience related to academic and career interests. This
may lead to permanent employment upon graduation. Although most internships are in the San
Diego area, the Academic Internship Program is national in scope including the popular
<!-- Find a link here -->Washington, D.C. program (UCDC) where housing arrangements and orientations are part of the program.

<p>
An extensive library at the AIP office lists over 1500 available internships in varied settings
including but not limited to: TV and radio stations, law offices, medical research labs and clinics,
government agencies, high-tech and biotech companies, engineering, advertising and public
relations and firms, and financial institutions. Students can also work with the internship office to
set up their own positions.

<p>
The program operates all four quarters; students intern a minimum of ten hours per week and can
earn units of upper-division credit ranging from zero to twelve in increments of four. Four of the
units awarded through this program can be applied to the major providing a student does not have
any other P/NP units applied to the major and the internship is overseen by a Communication
faculty member. The student petition for AIP 197 must describe where the internship was done,
what duties the intern performed, who the faculty advisor was. The petition should be turned in to
the Undergraduate Coordinator who will obtain the necessary signatures prior to sending the form
to the student's college advising office. Final disposition of your petition should be obtained from
your college advising office, after three weeks.

<p>
The Academic Internship Program office is located on the second floor in the Literature building at
Warren College.

<h2><center><a name="GN199">Special Studies COGN 198 and 1999</a></center></h2>

<p>
A Special Studies 198 is a directed group study of more than one student on a topic or in a field not
included in the regular curriculum by special arrangement with a faculty member. The course
generally meets ~n an as needed basis.

<p>
Special Studies 199 is an independent study on a topic or in a field not included in the regular
curriculum by special arrangement with a faculty member and meets on an as needed basis.

<p>
A student wishing to participate in an Independent study (199) or Directed Group study (198) must obtain a "special studies" form from the main office.  The form should be filled out in consultation with the faculty member sponsoring the course and turned in to the undergraduate coordinator by the end of the first week of classes.  The form will be processed and stamped by the department and given to the student for submission to the Registrar's.  Four of the units awarded through this program can be applied to the major providing a student does not have any other P/NP units applied to the major and the special studies is overseen by a Communication faculty member.
