Question: Early writing and printing technologies differ from recent
digital media methods.  Do new technologies qualitatively change the
publishing process?</b></p>

<!--  Here's my outline:
	I.  Intro
		Yes.  Qualitative change.  New information formats.
	2.  Analog & paper publishing formats
		Limitations of, costs, etc.
	3.  Digital methods
		Unlimited variety of information formats
			Find some example (i.e., high energy physics, database, etc.)
	4.  Conclusion
		More BS

<p>
New digital publishing techniques qualitatively change the publishing 
process.  Digital publishing has created entirely new forms of 
information with no analog counterpart.  As digital media become 
dominant, the limitations of paper publishing are only now becoming 
obvious.  Paper limits both the volume of information and its format.  
Information on paper is by nature unmanipulatable and inflexible.  It 
is a one-way flow from the author to the reader without the 
possibility of interaction.

<p>
Writing and printing techniques limit the type and volume of 
information available.  Books do not allow the database storage and 
retrieval of digital media.  CD-ROM encyclopedias now contain video 
and audio clips.  They can contain sophisticated search engines with 
instant references.  One CD-ROM contains a huge variety of information 
not accessible in print media.

<p>
Digital media also allow real-time interaction with the reader, creating 
an interactive environment not possible with traditional publishing 
methods.  What <a href="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research
</a> (1997) describes as "Transactive Content" is an example of this.  It 
is content and transaction driven by input from the reader.  Web sites 
take cues from the reader and tailor content and transactions to the 
reader's perceived needs and desires.  This interaction is an entirely new 
form of mass communication.

<p>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo's</a> <a 
href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py">map database</a> is a another 
good example of a format not possible with analog media.  On a user query 
it will display a map of anywhere in the country.  Microsoft's <a 
href="http://terraserver.microsoft.com/">TerraServer</a> contains satellite 
images of almost everywhere on the planet.  The analog equivalent to this 
page would require huge amounts of paper and would be extremely slow to 
search.  It would be spatially located, limiting access to a small audience.  
The digital version is quick and accessible around the world.  This 
difference represents a qualitative change from traditional print media.

<p>
Digital publishing also offers three dimensional imaging and 
manipulation not available in print media.  Organic molecules can be 
modeled, displayed, rotated, and manipulated in ways not possible with 
analog media.  <a href="http://bluebonnet.pai.utexas.edu/">The 
University of Texas at Austin Botany Department</a> has a "<a 
href="http://bluebonnet.pai.utexas.edu/test/movies/">space 
filling model of a glucan chain of cellulose</a>" on their web page.  This 
model could be made physically, but could not be published to a large 
audience.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a> 
has various two and three dimensional models of the <a 
href="http://sdbay.sdsc.edu/html/modeling2.html">San Diego Bay</a>.  
These digital models of complex biological systems are possible only with 
powerful computational resources.  They are available to a large audience 
on the World Wide Web only because of advances in digital 
communication technologies.  In an article for <a 
href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/istl/98-summer/index.html">
Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship</a> Vincent H. Resh 
(1998) says that electronic publishing allows a variety of information 
not available with traditional media.  He describes an on-line journal 
<i>New Astronomy</i> with a model of "how one star sucks up matter 
from the other."  This complex visual imaging and manipulation is 
possible only with the advent of digital publishing, and it represents a 
qualitative change from the static content of traditional print media.
