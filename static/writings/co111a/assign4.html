Digital technologies have and will continue to change the business 
world.  They are changing the nature of business transactions by 
eliminating layers of mediation between producer and consumer.  
This shortening of the supply chain has changed the types and 
number of available jobs.  Digital communications have changed 
the costs associated with start-up businesses.  Digital storage, 
retrieval, and communication methods are also changing 
marketing techniques.

<p>
Digital communication protocols such as the World Wide Web, 
electronic mail, and FTP reduce the communication distance 
between supply and demand.  Traditional retail outlets require 
managers, salespeople, and distribution networks.  The web 
reduces all of these to a graphical user interface leading to 
the producer.  Ordering a computer from the <a
href="http://www.gateway.com/">Gateway</a> web site is a 
very different process than going to Fry's for the same product.  
This change reduces in-store labor costs while it creates new 
costs of web design, programming, and maintenance.  While the 
costs do not always pay for themselves, companies feel forced 
to enter the on-line arena to prepare for the mythical time 
when e-commerce rules the world.

<p>
Another aspect of the move to electronic commerce and an 
information economy is the loss of jobs in less technical fields.  
Salespeople, marketers, store managers, and parts of the 
distribution networks are all being replaced by digital 
technologies (<a href="#Edupage">Edupage</a>).  Their jobs are 
replaced by employees skilled in computer software and graphic 
design, which often require more education and training 
(<a href="#Hall">Hall</a>,<a href="#BC">B.C. Ministry of 
Education</a>).  Automation in production, along with the move 
to a global economy, has eliminated many factory jobs.

<p>
The start-up costs associated with an on-line business are 
entirely different from those of a traditional retailer.  For a 
few thousand dollars in hardware and $20 per month in internet 
access anyone can have access to a global audience.  Establishing 
and maintaining an e-commerce site, however, requires a degree 
of technical knowledge that is still rare.  With the inevitable 
improvement of web design software such as Microsoft 
FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver, the skill required will 
decrease.

<p>
The problem on the web is not a lack of audience, it is a scarcity 
of attention.  Enter a search for "books" at <a 
href="http://www.excite.com/">excite.com</a> and a paid banner 
for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a> pops up.  
Enter "computer software" and a Compaq ad appears.  There may 
an independent bookstore with prices cheaper than amazon.com 
on the web, but it will take much more effort to find it.

<p>
Digital communications have begun to change the marketing 
industry as well.  Large-scale databases allow the collection of 
minute details about individual spending.  Shopping "clubs" like 
those of Ralph's and Vons, record every item bought by their 
customers.  These records are sold to direct marketers who 
create detailed consumer profiles.  Marketers use the profiles 
to target consumers with their desired characteristics (<a 
href="#Turow">Turow</a>).  This degree of profiling and target 
marketing is made possible only by the storage and retrieval 
functions of large digital databases.

<p>
Digital technologies are changing the business and marketing
landscape at a rapid pace.  New technologies, however, emerge within
the political and social climate of the time.  In the United States
they are appropriated and used within the context of mass production
and mass advertising.  The subversive and potentially revolutionary
qualities of emerging communication methods are subdued by their
placement in an economy of commercial media and mass production.
