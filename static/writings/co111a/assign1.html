<P>
Access to new digital media and electronic publishing will significantly change the way in which we interact with others.  Electronic publishing provides an opportunity to redefine culture as we know it.  The emerging digital culture has the potential to be far more democratic than existing cultural outlets, but it is subject to the same market and hegemonic forces that have shaped current entertainment and news media.  Access to digital media <em>may</em> create a new global consciousness, but it has helped to increase social and economic stratification.  Digital media will change every aspect of our lives; from business, politics, and education to entertainment and personal communication.
<P>
Unlike traditional media outlets, on the World Wide Web everybody is on almost an equal level.  It is just as easy to go to <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</A> as it is to go to <A HREF="http://gate.cruzio.com/~hiram/index.html">The 
Museum of Hiram.</A>  The internet is the ultimate "think globally, act locally" medium.  In an article for <a href="http://www.thenation.com">The Nation</a> Andrew Shapiro claims that "the Net can be used to change the power dynamics of media and communications"(June 8, 1998, p. 36).  Digital communications provide the framework for world-wide communication between individuals acting as both producers and readers.  I am now the proud owner of a web site accessible from anywhere in the world.  I can publish anything I want and say anything I want.  <a href="http://sdcc17.ucsd.edu/~spayneti/index.html">Sam's Big Waste of Time</a> allows me to spread my opinions to anyone who will listen.  This is a very different process; to create rather than consume.  The process of creating my site led to reflection on what is important to me and what I want to say.
<P>
Digital technologies will change the way I communicate with other people primarily by expanding my world and my resources.  It is a very different thing to read about Kosovian refugees in the L.A. Times than it is to see their own pictures and read their own words.  The <a href="http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_md.htm">U.S. Committee for Refugees</a> provides just that.  When the Kosovo people themselves are making their web site, much greater progress will have been made.  When less than two percent of the world has access to electronic mail, it can hardly be called a democratizing medium (<a href="http://www.lsilink.com/usage_regions.html"> ITM Solutions Inc.</a>).  Although differences of knowledge and wealth prevent complete equality, these differences will fade.
<P>
At UCSD I've been introduced to the World Wide Web and web publishing.  The web has given me access to a world of information not previously available.  I am now more comfortable buying books at Amazon.com than at the local Super Crown.  I would rather find a map on <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py">Yahoo</a> than at the library. The web allows an instant link to the rest of the world, to get a glimpse into the mind of <a href="http://wwwusers.imaginet.fr/~jensting/index.html">Jens Tingleff</a>, a Danish professor with whom I may or may not be related.  I have used electronic mail to send my parents class essays for suggestions.  From 500 miles away they can read and comment on my work.  Although I rarely listen to them, this technology has changed the way I write papers.  The internet has expanded my horizons, providing tangible proof that the world does not begin and end in California.
<P>
Access to digital technologies will continue to change my interactions with other people, although not significantly with my primary group of friends and relatives.  The most important interactions of my life occur primarily in person.  This aspect of my life, I suspect, will never change.
