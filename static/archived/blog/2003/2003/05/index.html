<h3 id="a000284">This visit to NY is</h3>

<p>This visit to NY is all about the food. Dinner last night at <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/35699758/">General Store</a>, brunch today at <a href="http://cuisinenet.com/info/?v=237&amp;/New_York_City/rest/4842.shtml">Balthazar</a>, lunch at <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter &amp; Co.</a> (my 2nd time) and dinner at <a href="http://www.luparestaurant.com/">Lupa</a>. Tomorrow we'll have brunch at 7A and lunch at Shopsin's (from Calvin Trillan). And we picked up a cheescake (plain) from <a href="http://www.eileenscheesecake.com/">Eileen's</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say I'm having a great time and I wish I could stay longer.</p>

<h3 id="a000282">Restroom extortion</h3>

<p>So I'm at the Storyville Jazz Club tonight with two colleagues and seven SAP customers. Keep in mind this is a dirty club on Bourbon Street and not some high-class joint. We're having a good time drinking beer and listening to music. I excuse myself and go to the restroom. Two guys are in there wearing monkey suits and 'assisting' patrons.</p>
<p>I take care of business. As soon as I turn around and head towards the sink one of these guys is right on me with the liquid soap. While I wash my hands the other guy places a clean towel on my shoulders for me to dry my hands. I dry off, throw the towel in the basket and start to walk out the door.</p>
<p>I know they're expecting a tip. I'm not down with it for two reasons: 1) it's a small bathroom and there's no room or reason for two guys to stand around getting in the way; 2) I am (and I hope everybody else is as well) perfectly capable of washing and drying my hands all by myself. As I walk out the first guy (with the soap) says "Hey!" and points to the tip jar with a five in it. The other guy puts his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I say "Hey what?" and assess the situation. I figure whatever else might happen is not worth a buck, so I put a dollar in the jar. The first (towel guy) dude puts out his hand to shake mine, pulls me close and says, "hey man, relax." I tell him I <i>am</i> relaxed and walk out.</p>

<h3 id="a000281">Having a great time in</h3>

<p>Having a great time in New Orleans but unfortunately I've had a mild cold for two days and haven't really been able to enjoy myself. I love the food here but sometimes it's too spicy for me. Unfortunately Emeril's was a no go this time. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>My flight leaves for New York (through O'Hare - d'oh!) tomorrow at 7 am.</p>

<p>The Wall St. Journal: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB105294526966494700,00.html?mod=todays_us_personaljnl_hs">How to Fake A Hard Day at the Office</a> [from <a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a>]:
<blockquote>
"E-mail timers, a standard feature in Microsoft Outlook, let you send e-mails hours after you have gone to bed -- a painless way to suggest to the boss that you are burning the midnight oil. (In Outlook, open up a message, go to "options," and fill in the "do not deliver before" option.)"

Usually stories like this take the opposite position; that all these new mobile technologies only lead to work encroaching on formerly free time. It's good to see the <a href="http://donsbosspage.com/">slacker view</a> as well.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/29/health/nutrition/29VITA.html">Vitamins: More May Be Too Many</a>:
<blockquote>
Researchers say that vitamin supplements cannot correct for a poor diet, that multivitamins have not been shown to prevent any disease and that it is easy to reach high enough doses of certain vitamins and minerals to actually increase the risk of disease.<br/>
No longer, the experts say, are they concerned about vitamin deficits. Those are almost unheard of today, even with the population eating less than ideal diets and skimping on fruits and vegetables. Instead, the concern is with the dangers of vitamin excess.
