<h3 id="a000198">Is this based on a true story?</h3>

<p>After an excellent dinner at Taqueria Vallarta, Breean and I saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0289992">The Life of David Gale</a> with the 'rents on Saturday.</p>
<p>One of the country's leading anti-capital punishment activists (Kevin Spacey) is charged with murder and sent to <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/finalmeals.htm" title="final meal requests">Texas' death row</a>. One week before death he requests a series of three interviews with a journalist (Kate Winslet). The movie is primarily her quest to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>My only complaint with this movie is that not enough was left unsaid. What separates David Gale from <i>The Usual Suspects</i> or <i>Memento</i> is suspense. Otherwise it was cool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/business/24REAL.html">Networks Plan Flood of Reality Shows for Summer</a>
<blockquote>
 In "Roseanne," for example, camera crews will follow the comedian Roseanne Barr as she pitches a cooking show to cable networks and searches for men on a Jewish Internet dating service. "The Will" plans to enlist a rich benefactor to put his potential heirs through all sorts of tests to determine who will inherit his fortune. And then there is "The Simple Life," a reality-show version of the old situation comedy "Green Acres," in which a pair of privileged young women, the hotel heiress Paris Hilton and her best friend Nicole Richie, will move in with a hardscrabble farm family.

<h3 id="a000191">wtf?</h3>

<p>Doing my taxes this year I needed to know when I bought a particular stock. This was a real <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BMC&amp;d=v1">stinker</a> and I'm glad I finally got rid of it. But despite the fact that Breean considers me a pack rat, I don't have any record of the date I made the mistake of buying this stock.</p>
<p>I looked at my account history on my broker's web site (<a href="http://www.tradingdirect.com/">Trading Direct</a>) and saw that it would not go far enough back (only 2000). I called them and was told that they would have to look through <i>microfiche</i> records and that it would cost me $5 per page.</p>

<p>Just saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0290538">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</a>. It's based on the 'unauthorized autobiography' of  Chuck Barris, creator of The Dating Game and The Gong Show. George Clooney directs, Drew Barrymore costars, Julia Roberts puts in an appearance and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Kaufman,%20Charlie">Charlie Kaufman</a> (Adaptation) wrote the screenplay. I liked it.</p>
<p>In his autobiography Barris claims he was recruited by the CIA and trained as a covert operative. This is the story of his double life.</p>
<p>Sorry about the lack of updates here. There's a few things I've been meaning to write about - Chez Panisse and Shanghai Knights (both great) last weekend, and... oh well, I don't remember anything else. Grandma asked if we went to Chez Panisse to celebrate me getting into school. Don't worry Grandma, you'll hear it here first.</p>

<p>Went to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0299658">Chicago</a> yesterday afternoon ($7.50 for a matinee!). This is a difficult movie to fit into my two-star rating system. It's slow at times and I could have lived with fewer musical numbers. If you go, expect a play and not a movie. In that context I can recommend it.</p>
<p>Queen Latifah has the best role as the women's prison 'mama'. It's too bad she only has one song - compared to her Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones have no stage presence at all. In short... this movie <i><b>sucks</b></i>.</p>
