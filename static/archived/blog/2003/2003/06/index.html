<p>If there's anything I would have liked to do more than help Meagan move on Saturday, I can't think of it now. Here she is with her new <a href="http://www.dachiu.com/gallery/pix.html">bearded dragon</a>, Oz</p>

<h3 id="a000312">Back to school</h3>

<p>After UCSD I never, ever expected to go to graduate school. Especially in business.</p>
<p>Here I am, 3 1/2 years later, about to start at the <a href="http://www.johson.cornell.edu/">Johnson School of Management</a> at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. The call came in Monday and I expect to send in the offer letter some time next week.</p>
<p>Lots of questions right now:
<ul>
 <li>How <strike>the frick</strike> will I pay for this this?</li>
 <li>Do I need a visa to live outside of California?</li>
 <li>Will anyone make the trek to beautiful Ithaca, NY to visit?</li>
 <li>Does the 'Ski Club' at an East Coast (with capitals) school allow snowboarding? And just how far is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/years/1980.htm">Lake Placid</a> from Ithaca?</li>

<h3 id="a000310">Yet Another Consultant Joke</h3>

<p>
A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly 
a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The 
driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd...<br/>
"If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will
you give me one?"<br/>
The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at
his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, "Sure."
The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM Thinkpad and 
connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and
then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex 
formulas.<br/>
He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received 
a response. Finally, he prints out a 130 page report on his
miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says.......
"You have exactly 1586 sheep."<br/>
"That is correct; take one of the sheep." said the shepherd. He
watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into
his car.<br/>
Then the shepherd says: "If I can tell you exactly what your
business is, will you give me back my animal?"<br/>
"OK, why not." answered the young man.<br/>
"Clearly, you are a consultant." said the shepherd. "That's
correct." says the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?" "No 
guessing required." answers the shepherd. "You turned up here 
although nobody called you. You want to get paid for
an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you
don't know crap about my business.... Now give me back my dog."

<h3 id="a000307">This is my only food-related complaint about the city</h3>

<p>I'm not going to claim that you can't find a good burrito in New York, even Brooklyn. Maybe not a <i>Taqueria Vallarta</i> quality burrito, but a decent, Baja Fresh quality burrito is definitely available here.</p>
<p>What they have not yet learned is how to package it. A burrito should be <a href="http://www.snapcity.com/past/snap59/burrito.html">wrapped in foil</a>, both for onsite and offsite consumption. Without this packaging you're stuck either eating with a knife and fork or scarfing with two hands.</p>
<p>The knife and fork approach is, I'm sorry, <i>just wrong</i> for a burrito. The scarfing approach is messy and leaves a ton of waste for fork clean-up.</p>
<p>This innovation has spread <a href="http://www.snapcity.com/past/snap59/snap59.html">throughout California</a> but unfortunately seems not to have made it this far east.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday to me! It's hard to admit, but yeah, I turned 26 yesterday. Thanks everybody for the cards and gifts. They're very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Yesterday was actually day three of a three-day celebration. On day one Breean and I were in Eureka and her mom made a delicious fruit pie. Day two we had a very nice dinner with my mom &amp; dad at <a href="http://www.restaurantzibibbo.com/">Zibibbo</a>. Yesterday wasn't as exciting... <a href="http://www.rwsplash.com/">Raging Waters</a> was in the afternoon plan but after seeing the traffic on 101 S, fuggedaboutit.

<p>I have some serious complaints about international roaming with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cingular%20sucks" title="Search for 'cingular sucks' on google">Cingular Wireless</a>. I'm in Frankfurt right now and my phone obviously has a signal. It says E-Plus is the carrier. But call my number and you'll get an error that "your call cannot be completed as dialed." This is unacceptable. It's obviously so much worse than just putting the call into my voice mail. But anyway voice mail <i>never</i> works when I'm outside the country. If I miss or reject the call... nothing.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Germany this time I could make outgoing calls within Europe but <i>not</i> to the U.S. When I called <a href="http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/hatecingular/">customer disservice</a> said there was a lock on my account for this particular feature but could not give a reason. I've done just this many times in the past without problems and nothing has changed with my account. Do they have little elves mischievously hacking customer accounts for fun?</p>

<h3 id="a000289">I've been in Sofia, Bulgaria</h3>

<p>I've been in <a href="http://www.travel-bulgaria.com/content/sofia.shtml">Sofia</a>, Bulgaria since Tuesday evening, working at the SAP office during the day and doing all I can to avoid second-hand smoke at night. I'm staying at the <a href="http://www.sofiahotels.net/downtown.shtml">Hotel Downtown</a> which is right next to both a casino and a 'vodka doctor'. I have suspicions that they're owned by the same person but I have no way to verify that.</p>
<p>Yesterday I talked to a friend working here who just graduated from the Sofia university. He was working at SAP full time for the last six months of school, even travelling to headquarters in Walldorf for weeks at a time. He actually <i>paid somebody to attend class discussions</i> in his place. And unlike many of his colleagues here he graduated on time.</p>
<p>With ingenuity like that I have no doubt that Bulgaria will soon be an economic power in Eastern Europe. I'm so impressed with the people I've met here that I think it's a perfect time to start a Bulgarian venture capital fund. You'd have to take a longer timeline, maybe ten years or more, but you could make a ton of money investing in infrastructure. The only problem seems to be the corrupt government.</p>

<h3 id="a000287">FCC Rolls Over. Something is</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/dbriefing/2003/23/we_427_03.html">FCC Rolls Over</a>. Something is very wrong with the FCC. Even <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=68&amp;ncid=68&amp;e=9&amp;u=/nyt/20030602/ts_nyt/f_c_c__votes_to_relax_rules_limiting_media_ownership">Ted Turner</a> and the former FCC chair are in agreement. Are people writing the FCC to say "yes, we need more media consolidation and less independent media"? I don't think so. The media giants bought this vote with campaign money.</p>

<h3 id="a000286">Free advice and etc.</h3>

<p>First the free advice: don't ever drive from Berlin to Munich the day after a big soccer game. I drove from Heidelberg to Berlin and back last weekend with a colleague and it took <i>eleven</i> hours to return. It's only 600 km. With hungover soccer hoodlums driving 200+ km/hr there will be accidents. But the German freeways never have service lanes so it takes forever to clear an accident up.</p>
<p>When will the rest of the world catch up with California (and NYC - thanks Bloomberg!) and ban smoking indoors? What would it take for human rights organizations to adopt this issue? Do we really have to wait for all the smokers to <strike>die off</strike> quit?</p>
<p>Now I too know someone from the Bay Area software industry with a Russian bride. I even met her. And I still don't get it.</p>
