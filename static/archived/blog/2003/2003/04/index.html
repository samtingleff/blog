<p>It's almost impossible to get anything done at a German company between April and June.

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=599&amp;ncid=988&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/iraq_media_bbc_dc">BBC Chief Attacks U.S. Media War Coverage</a>:
<blockquote>
U.S. broadcasters' coverage of the Iraq war was so unquestioningly patriotic and so lacking in impartiality that it threatened the credibility of America's electronic media, the head of the BBC said on Thursday.<br/>
...<br/>
 U.S. broadcasters came under attack for "cheerleading" during the Iraq conflict, with what some critics saw as gung-ho reporting and flag-waving patriotism. In one example, a U.S. network described U.S. soldiers as "heroes" and "liberators."<br/>
<br/>
Dyke suggested the problem stemmed from the recent fragmentation of media, with no single network having the clout to stand up to the U.S. government.
</blockquote>
Clear Channel has been <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,54038,00.html">under attack</a> for a while now but it's hard to imagine their coverage could be <a href="http://www.fair.org/reports/fox.html">worse than Fox</a>. There must be a lot of people in the U.S. that turned to the BBC and NPR - I just hope the networks noticed.</p>

At the 2003 New York International Automobile Show, Volvo unveiled a car that actually cleans the air around it, while Ford showed off a car that uses recyclable organic materials for its interior.<br/>
Volvo's Versatility Concept Car, while powered by a standard combustion engine, includes a patented air filtering system that the company claims does more good than harm. The Volvo Ambient Air Cleaner system sucks in air from outside the vehicle and removes the nasty hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides by burning them up in the engine and catalytic converter.<br/>
According to Volvo spokesman Christopher Westerberg, this filtering process can actually remove the equivalent of three cars' exhaust emissions during the course of a day.<br/>

<blockquote>
While past estimates varied up to 140,000, two international scientific teams have now shown the true number is between 27,000 and 40,000. The finding deals a heavy blow to genetic determinism, the idea that many aspects of a person's life are controlled by their genes.

<blockquote>
The religious overtones in President Bush's speeches increasingly grate on many ears in Europe, where leaders invoking God in times of war are widely suspect of misusing faith for political purposes.<br/>
...<br/>
 In his speeches, he has asked for guidance from "the loving God behind all of life and all of history," hinted he believed there was a "divine plan" for the world and warned Americans that "we are in a conflict between good and evil."<br/>
</blockquote>
Obviously Bush's religious imagery increases the perception in the Arab world that this is a religious war. My hope is that it also alienates more and more of secular America and Europe.

<h3 id="a000235">It's on my calendar</h3>

<p>I'm feeling better today. The sore throat is mostly gone and my fever feels much better. I woke up sweating like a pig a few times last night though.</p>

<h3 id="a000234">I called the Stanford Medical</h3>

<p>I called the <a href="http://www.stanfordhospital.com/">Stanford Medical Center</a> at 11:30 today and they were able to get me in at 11:50. The good news is that I don't have <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=SARS">SARS</a> and I probably don't have strep. The bad news is that I have a 100.2 degree fever. The doctor said I need a vacation.</p>
