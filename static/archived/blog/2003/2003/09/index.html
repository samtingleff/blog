<h3 id="a000370">Talk of the chimp town</h3>

<p>The New Yorker Talk of the Town this week <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?031006ta_talk_surowiecki">discusses the objection</a> to Dick Grasso's $180m compensation package. The really interesting part, though, is the author's conclusion that monkeys - not to mention people - "seem to believe that there should be a clear connection between work and pay."<br/>
I'll just add that if there's one thing I've learned so far in school it's that economists are deeply disturbed people (no offense John).
<blockquote>
It so happened that, on the very day Grasso resigned, the primatologists Sarah F. Brosnan and Frans B. M. de Waal released a study showing that female brown capuchin monkeys seem to have a sense of fairness, too.<br/>
<br/>
Pairs of capuchins had been trained to give Brosnan pebbles in exchange for slices of cucumber. This idyllic monkey market economy was disrupted, though, when the scientists changed the pay scale, rewarding one monkey with a delicious grape and the other with the same measly old cucumber. Exposed to this injustice, the capuchins who were given cucumbers often refused to eat; forty per cent of the time, they stopped trading entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Things got worse when one monkey in each pair was given a grape for doing nothing at all. The other monkeys often responded by tossing away their pebbles; eighty per cent of the time, they stopped trading. The capuchins were willing to forfeit cheap food simply to express their displeasure at their partners&rsquo; unearned riches.

<h3 id="a000369">WSJ.com reports on (only available</h3>

<p>WSJ.com <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB106479068042179400,00.html?mod=home%5Fpage%5Fone%5Fus">reports on</a> (only available to subscribers) a German author's thesis that "the U.S. government staged the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq." The author admits that the theory is tentative, basing most of it on doubt that al Queda was responsible for the attacks ("That's something that is simply 99% false").</p>
<p>The author, Andreas von Bulow, is a former German cabinet minister now "from one of the country's most prestigious publishing houses and who lectures at well-known public institutions." Reaction seems to be mixed:
<blockquote>
In conversations with a dozen visitors, one woman said she found Mr. Bulow's theories bunk, while others said they found them plausible.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't believe all of it," said Daniel Feifal, a 24-year-old architecture student. "That would destroy my belief in humanity. But that they knew about the attacks and let them happen because it could further their foreign-policy aims, yes, I'm prepared to believe that."
</blockquote>

<p>This is our new house pet. It lives on the front porch, just feet away from the front door. I think it's getting bigger every day and I pray that's not because of pregnancy. If there's anything I dislike more than spiders I can't think of it right now.</p>

<h3 id="a000367">Cheap weekend travel</h3>

<p>We spent the weekend at the <a href="http://www.lakevanarecabins.com/">Lake Vanare Cabins</a> with Penni and Jeff, friends visiting from San Diego. It was extremely ralaxing, for me anyway. Breean, Penni and Jeff went on a long hike Friday afternoon while I was still in school. I got no such exercise.</p>
<p>It's definitely fall here. The temperature drops about five degrees every day. But the leaves are beginning to change color. It's beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/business/23BEEF.html">Cheeseburger and Fries, Wrapped Up in One</a>: The National Cattlemen's Beef Association "is hoping to inject some red meat into the American snack food diet with cheeseburger fries. The fries, which look like a squat version of standard French fries, are made of a meat-and-cheese compound that tastes - as the name suggests - like a cheeseburger."</p>
<p>My first reaction is of course revulsion, but if one of these gutbusters dropped on my plate I'd give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="a000359">Color-coding airline passengers</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,60456,00.html">JetBlue Data to Fuel CAPPS Test</a> Color-coding airline passengers by risk:
<blockquote>
The TSA's second set of rules laid out in detail a system that would require all domestic travelers to provide their name, address, date of birth and home phone number when purchasing an airline ticket. The government would then check that information against private databases, terrorist watch lists and felony warrant lists in order to prevent suspected terrorists and wanted violent felons from boarding airplanes. 
<br/><br/>
Each passenger would be given a green, yellow or red color code to let screeners know what level of scrutiny to give a passenger or whether to call in law enforcement agents immediately.
</blockquote>
JetBlue will provide old passenger itineraries for testing.<br/>
<b>Update:</b> JetBlue has <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_09_01_archive.html#106428948481651005">changed its mind</a> and "decided against further participation."</p>

<p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14BUDDHISM.html">Is Buddhism Good for Your Health?</a>
<blockquote>
The fact that the brain can learn, adapt and molecularly resculpture itself on the basis of experience and training suggests that meditation may leave a biological residue in the brain -- a residue that, with the increasing sophistication of new technology, might be captured and measured...<br/>
<br/>
''What's being measured,'' Davidson explained, ''is a person's capacity to voluntarily regulate their emotional reactions.''<br/>
Daren Jackson, the lead researcher on the study, added, ''Meditation may facilitate more rapid, spontaneous recovery from negative reactions.''

<h3 id="a000353">Mom's beef stew (requires crock pot)</h3>

<p>Here's the first in a (hopefully) series of what I'll call <i>food for real people</i>. This is a delicious beef stew recipe from my mom. The biggest problem with it is that it needs to be prepared in the morning when you probably have better things to do. On the upside there's very little work to do at dinner time.</p>
<p>Ingredients required: <i>1 lb beef stew meat, 1 uncooked italian sausage, 4 cups water, 1 cup flour, 1 cup red wine, several potatoes, carrots, pearl onions, garlic, basil</i>.</p>
<p>
 <ol>
  <li>Flour the stew meat and brown (but don't cook) in a frying pan with olive oil</li>
  <li>Wash the vegetables and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
  <li>Combine everything in the crock pot and stir</li>
  <li>Add any additional vegetables and season to taste</li>
  <li>Cook on low for 8-10 hours or high for 6-8 hours</li>
 </ol>

Once you start sending away the junior engineers and first line project manager jobs, you are really starting to eat the seed corn.

<h3 id="a000348">I'd like to work there</h3>

<p>In my Managing and Leading Organizations class today we watched a video about <a href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, the famous industrial design firm. The point of the case was to illustrate their ability to "institutionalize innovation" - to continually create innovate products for a variety of industries.</p>
<p>The video followed them throughout a five-day project to redesign the shopping cart. On the last day they took the prototype cart to - you guessed it - Whole Foods Market in Palo Alto, my former grocery store. The employees were very impressed.</p>
<p>Here's a few of my takeaways from their process:
 <ul>
  <li>No titles or hierarchies for the duration of the project. One project leader was selected for his ability to work with teams (not seniority, technical skill, etc.).</li>
  <li>Separate brainstorming from criticism. During the brainstorm session there are no bad ideas.</li>
  <li>Vote for ideas by placing a post-it with your name next to a written description of the idea on the wall. The few ideas with the most votes are chosen for follow-up.</li>
  <li>The importance of play. Employees at IDEO are encouraged to bring in toys and to keep the environment light.</li>
  <li>Actively search out conflicting views. Management claims to hire people that <i>do not listen to their boss</i>.</li>
 </ul>

Forests reduce erosion, filter pollutants and store water -- and they do so more cost-effectively than water treatment plants."</p>

No, contend other equally respected nutritional experts. Potatoes and other starchy standbys are perfectly respectable. A carb is a carb is a carb."</p>
