<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030130/tech_sap_5.html">SAP defies software gloom with 2002 profit</a>. I'm not surprised that we beat our operating margin target. But sales actually grew 1% over 2001.</p>
<blockquote>
 SAP has benefited from the market slump by taking business from smaller rivals that have fallen out of favour in the current climate but also boosted its market share against key U.S. rivals, such as Oracle Corp and PeopleSoft.<br/>
 For the first time ever, SAP passed Siebel Systems in the key customer relationship management (CRM) segment in the fourth quarter and consolidated its lead in the supply chain management segment over rival i2 Technologies.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/15/business/15BRIC.html">Not Building Green Is Called a Matter of Economics</a></p>
<p>Specialists say green construction is limited because "a compelling case demonstrating the economic rewards has not been made." I never would have guessed it, but buildings are responsible for 36% of the country's energy consumption (vs. 27% for transportation).</p>

<p>I'm finishing up my <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a> application. Having trouble with this question: <i>Write a letter to the admissions committee, dated at the end of your first year of your MBA program. The letter describes the person you have become during that year.</i></p>
<p>My problem is describing my future self as somehow improved from my current self, without making my current self sound like a total loser (whatever the truth may be). And reading the student profiles in school brochures is just about the most depressing thing I've ever done.</p>
<blockquote><i>
Before being named CEO of Intel in 1995, Craig Barrett worked in Nigeria for five years saving small puppies from the Ebola virus. As an dual major in Electrical Engineering and Chemistry at Harvard he maintained a 4.0 GPA while fulfilling his duties as student president. After graduation he hopes to solve world hunger, cure cancer and make his second $10 billion.

So here's the irony: Every economic proposal we're hearing is to increase capital! Like any age, we're focused on the problem that we started with, not the one in front of us. Our economic problem is obvious: we don't know how to inspire and deploy the energy and skill of our work force, so instead, we're trying to put more money into the hands of the wealthy so they'll invest it in enterprises which will be better equipped to do more of what already isn't working.
