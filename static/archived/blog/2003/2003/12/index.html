<h3 id="a000555">2003: The Year in Review</h3>

<p>From Dave Barry, <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/7579165.htm">2003: A Dave odyssey</a>.
<blockquote>
Saddam himself is nowhere to be found, though he does release a videotape announcing plans to take his career ''in a new direction,'' possibly including a ''reality'' TV show called Queer Eye for a Dictator Guy, in which he will undergo a makeover by five gay men, who will then be executed.

<h3 id="a000550">Now we're looking for a Vietnamese Buddhist monk to come to Cancun</h3>

<p>It was pretty interesting to see a Buddhist wedding in Anaheim last weekend. Breean's best friend Thuy was getting married. The temple was great - I like the the rotating light circles on the wall. All the monks were women, or at least I'm told.</p>
<p>The day started with the Buddhist wedding (in Vietnamese), then progressed to a Catholic church for another ceremony (in Vietnamese), and ended with a reception (also in Vietnamese) for 500 people at the Anaheim Marriott.</p>

<p>Long travel day today. We flew out of Long Beach at 8:30 am PST and just arrived home at 1:30 am EST. Have fun tomorrow mom &amp; dad! It's great to be home though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jetblue.com/">Jet Blue</a> is great, BTW. Free wireless at the JFK and Long Beach terminals, and a satellite tv at every seat.</p>

<p>I flew into sunny San Diego last night. Watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310910/">Confidence</a> on the flight. It's a solid crime drama in the vein of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/">The Italian Job</a>. Recommended.</p>
<p>Today I wore a t-shirt outside for the first time in months. It feels great. Looking forward to visiting friends and the fam.</p>

<h3 id="a000536">Another leading indicator</h3>

<p>From the NY Times, <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/10/dining/10POWE.html?ex=1386392400&en=cebeb2a1211e1f7b&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">The Powering Up of the Power Lunch</a>:
<blockquote>
"It is all about making deals," said Mr. Niccolini, who in addition to being a co-owner of the Four Seasons is the keeper of the restaurant's lunchtime seating chart. "If our business is any sort of economic indicator, things are going well."<br/>
...<br/>
The recent burst of power lunching is not restricted to a few hot spots. Le Bernardin, Trattoria Dell'Arte and Orso have been playing to busy crowds, as has Tribeca Grill, while the "21" Club, which all but invented the modern rite of dining seasoned with power, is still storming along, replete with totems of industrial might &#8212; toy trucks and airplanes, and the like &#8212; hanging from the ceiling.

<h3 id="a000531">The Wal-Mart-ization of software</h3>

<p>NY Times: <a href="http://nytimes.com/2003/12/07/business/yourmoney/07out.html">Who Wins and Who Loses as Jobs Move Overseas?</a>:
<blockquote>
<b>Mr. Johnson</b> It's all about innovation and productivity. As long as we maintain those two engines, we'll continue to have a very high standard of living. Out in the Bay Area there are plenty of folks who would love to create a little bit of protectionism around their I.T. jobs, but we are far better off letting a lot of those jobs go. <i>Low-skill jobs like coding</i> are moving offshore and what's left in their place are more advanced project management jobs. (emphasis mine)
</blockquote>
This Mr. Johnson is "director of <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/">Tuck's Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies</a> at the <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/">Tuck School of Business</a>." Since when is coding a 'low-skill job'? Who the fu*k is he to say that? From <a href="http://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/tuck_faculty_and_research.faculty_profile?p_id=Q1X3CS">his bio</a> it looks like he has zero experience with software and has no idea what he's talking about. The <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/12/07/1938241.shtml?tid=187&tid=98&tid=99">/. crowd</a> is right to be angry.</p>
<p>There's always an opportunity when a dumb mindset like this takes hold - where is it here? High-quality, <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">adaptive development</a> with domain expertise and real customer service. Leave the offshore outsourcing to beancounters who think coding is 'low-level' and sell services to their nimble competitors.</p>

<p>Just for you, Breean: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/weekinreview/07LOHR.html?8hpib">Is Wal-Mart Good for America?</a>:
<blockquote>
The annual celebration of the American consumer economy &#8212; the holiday shopping season &#8212; is just underway, and Wal-Mart, the juggernaut of retailing, already seems to have claimed its first victim. The corporate owner of F.A.O. Schwarz stores said last week that it would file for bankruptcy. Bemoaning the news, analysts explained that the F.A.O. Schwarz formula of selling premium-priced toys in sumptuous surroundings could not withstand the steady advance of Wal-Mart into the toy business.

<h3 id="a000526">You learn something new every day</h3>

<p>Which is the most different animal? <input type="radio" name="animal" value="monkey"/> monkey <input type="radio" name="animal" value="zebra"/> zebra <input type="radio" name="animal" value="cow"/> cow</p>
<p>Today I learned that people across all cultures tend to organize animals in three ways:
 <ol>
  <li>Can it eat me?</li>
  <li>Can I eat it?</li>
  <li>How big is it?</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>Supposedly this has evolutionary causes. When cavedudes and dudettes first encountered an animal, the first concern was naturally if they were in danger. The second issue was if the animal could provide food. And the third? Really seems like a subset of the first two.</p>
<p>Neurologists think that Alzheimer's patients lose the ability to categorize based on the first two classifications and are only able to use the third. I must have it, because I would categorize based on intelligence, bidpedal/quadrupedal or size most of the time.</p>

Your best option is to send the file immediately upon receiving this email, and then deliver the hard copies tomorrow.

Unless this whole day was a dream I'm pretty sure that I turned in two (2) copies of my paper this morning in the two boxes clearly meant for that purpose. Maybe I imagined the other hundred students doing exactly the same thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/12/03/citrus.cancer.reut/index.html">Study: Oranges keep cancers away</a>:
<blockquote>
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), found consuming citrus fruits could reduce the risk of mouth, larynx and stomach cancers by up to 50 percent.<br/>
One extra serve of citrus a day -- on top of the recommended five daily servings of fruit and vegetables -- could also reduce the risk of a stroke by 19 percent.<br/>

Baghurst said oranges have the highest level of antioxidants of all fruit, with more than 170 different phytochemicals, including more than 60 flavonoids shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and blood clot inhibiting properties.

<h3 id="a000521">About last night</h3>

<p>
 <ul>
  <li>5 - 6:20 pm: Corporate briefing</li>
  <li>6:20 - 7 pm: Booze n' schmooze in the Johnson 'parlor'</li>
  <li>7 - 7:10 pm: Invited out to dinner, cancel on the high tech club</li>
  <li>7:30 - 11:00 pm: Dinner on the corporate tab at <i>Les Ducs</i></li>
  <li>11:15 pm - 12:30 am: Drinks at <a href="http://www.stellabar.com/bar.html">Stella's</a>, on the corporate tab</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p><i>Seven and a half hours</i> of networking, but it really wasn't that bad. The briefing was pretty typical but the meet n' greet was more personal than normal. All the employee reps were friendly and seemed very genuine. I wouldn't mind working there at all.</p>
<p>Dinner forced me to remember how nice it is to go out to eat somewhere nice once in a while, especially when The Corporation pays for it.</p>

<h3 id="a000520">Probably spam though</h3>

<p>Just received a job-related email from a tech recruiter I know in San Diego. It's the first contact any of them has initiated with me in a long time. Good sign.</p>

<h3 id="a000515">And I get a discount</h3>

<p>Just found out that I'll be on the <a href="http://www.jsoutfitters.com/">Johnson School Outfitters</a> management team for the next year. JSOutfitters is a small student-run business that sells <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/">Johnson School</a> clothing and other 'stuff' to students, alumni and families. They do about $6k in sales every year so it's not much money. But it will be interesting to run a small clothing co.</p>

<p>It is <i>cold</i>. Tonight's the first time snow has really stayed on the ground. This is probably the bottom layer of a snowpack we'll have till April.</p>
