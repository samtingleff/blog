<h3 id="a000433">Homework tomorrow...</h3>

<p>We just watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/">The Italian Job</a> (2003) on dvd. Breean and I both liked it a lot. It's a great story, now I want to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064505/">the original</a> as well.</p>

<p>Meagan's been asking why her <a href="2003/06/30/index.html">personal ad</a> has not attracted enough responses. The reason, apparently, is that the entry was closed for comments. So single guys, please <a href="2003/06/30/index.html">check her out</a> and leave a comment here or for that entry.</p>

<h3 id="a000431">Pringles</h3>

<p>The first case we discussed on the first day (today) of my introductory marketing class was Pringles. Development on Pringles started in the 50's when P&amp;G saw an opportunity for a national brand to "beat-up smaller and less sophisticated competitors". At the time the potato chip market was dominated by local producers because of the product's limited shelf life and frailty in transit. P&amp;G hoped to solve those problems with the round aluminum can and a product designed to have a shelf life of one year.</p>
<p>When Pringles was finally released in 1968 it quickly rose to 25% market share due to heavy trials but soon dropped to 7% because of few repeat purchases. Our professor's justification for the lack of repeat buyers was that customers 'inferred' an artificial taste from the strange packaging and year-long shelf life. My hand was raised but the professor never called on me, so I'll make my point here.</p>
<p>How could you assume that customers thought the taste was artificial <i>because of the packaging and shelf life</i>? Could it be that they actually looked at the ingredients and saw for themselves just how engineered the product was? Is this how marketing thinks - that there is no 'truth', only perception?</p>
<p>Pringles was discontinued in 1978, but as we all know became extremely successful in the 1980's and is now a $1b business. You could argue that I'm wrong, that consumers are now accustomed to strange packaging and potato chips with a half-life of one year. I think tastes have changed. In the potato chip aisle at Ralph's today, Pringles just might be the <i>least</i> artificial product available.</p>
