<h3 id="a000453">Happy Halloween</h3>

<p>We didn't have any trick-or-treaters at all tonight. What a disappointment! We're leaving now for the first frat party either of us have been to in years. Breean is going as the Garden of Eden. You'll see me later on <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/">her site</a> (you'd better, anyway).</p>

<h3 id="a000451">More history</h3>

<p>I spent this morning walking around campus in the putting up fliers for the Cornell <a href="http://www.brv.cornell.edu/bic.php">Business Idea Competition</a>. It was about 70 degrees and sunny, just a beautiful October 31st. I've hardly seen anything besides the business school and the gym, so it was great to see all the amazing architecture and history on campus.</p>
<p>Cornell has a building from 1880 named after one <a href="http://www.morsehistoricsite.org/">Samuel Morse</a>. Ezra Cornell started the company that <a href="http://www.webstationone.com/fecha/morse.htm">became Western Union</a>, and eventually founded the university with his proceeds.</p>

<h3 id="a000449">Credit card dangers</h3>

<p>Supposedly this went around "a large Valley company" (from <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/">SAP Ventures</a>). Sounds to me like yet another theft issue not worth worrying about. But I won't be turning in the keys next time I'm at a hotel.
<blockquote>
Although room keys differ from hotel to hotel, a key obtained from the "Double Tree" chain that was being used for a regional Identity Theft Presentation was found to contain the following the information:<br/>
a.. Customers (your) name<br/>
b.. Customers (your) partial home address<br/>
c.. Hotel room number<br/>
d.. Check in date and check out date<br/>
e.. Customers (your) credit card number and expiration date!<br/>
<br/>
When you turn them in to the front desk your personal information isthere for any employee to access by simply scanning the card in the hotel scanner.<br/>
The bottom line is, keep the cards or destroy them! NEVER leave them behind and NEVER turn them in to the front desk when you check out of a room. They will not charge you for the card. (Information courtesy of: Sergeant K. Jorge, Detective Sergeant, Pasadena Police Department)

<h3 id="a000447">Is network TV still relevant?</h3>

<p>WSJ.com <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB106739567748444700,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">reports</a> (sub required) that men age 18 to 34 are watching between 8% and 12% less prime-time television than they did last year. The networks think Nielsen is wrong about the data. Right...</p>

<h3 id="a000445">Just like you and me. But with more money</h3>

<p>We just watched <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/10/27/born_rich_reveals_privileged_information/">Born Rich</a> on HBO. It's fascinating. Jamie Johnson (of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.jnj.com/&e=7388">Johnson and Johnson</a>) directed it around his 21st birthday and the huge inheritance that meant.</p>
<p>I thought it was interesting because it seems to reveal that <i>(old) money just is not cool anymore</i>, and after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1880559641/qid=1067315103/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-0647282-3999332?v=glance&amp;s=books">Old Money</a> I think this is a relatively new environment. Pop culture defines cool these days, not some windbag Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>Breean <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2003/10/27/index.html#000443">points out</a> that our friends Penni and Jeff had to leave their home in Scripps Ranch, CA because of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/10/27/california.wildfire/index.html" title="CNN.com fire coverage">fires</a>.

<h2>October 26, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a000441">Two movies, one night</h3>

<p>Watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/">28 Days Later</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305357/">Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle</a> last night. Of the two 28 Days Later was far more interesting but much less pleasant on the eyes. A man wakes up from a coma to discover that a rage virus has taken over England, killing most of the population. It gets more interesting from there, but stay away if you don't like gore.</p>
<p>Nothing very positive to say about Charlie except that the first one was much better (Bill Murray).</p>

<h3 id="a000438">More scary than a haunted hay ride</h3>

<p>My cell phone went off in class today. D'oh! And <i>every single class</i> specifically addresses this in the syllabus.</p>
<p><b>Later...</b> in the comments my dad asks if "d'oh" is the proper spelling and says that he's always spelled it as just "doh." To that I'd say "d'oh!" for all those mispellings he's commited over the years. <a href="http://www.snpp.com/">The Simpsons Archive</a> <a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/lisa-3.html">says</a>:
<blockquote>
The correct way to spell it is "D'oh". Homer's trademark "D'oh" manifested out of a general exclamation to indicate anger, and therefore was and has always been referred to in scripts as "Annoyed Grunt." Therefore most titles that feature "D'oh" in them have the "D'oh" replaced with (Annoyed Grunt), e.g. E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt).<br/>
<br/>
The origins of "D'oh" can be traced to Jim Finlayson, who played support in many Laurel and Hardy films. His trademark was to yell "D'oooooooohhh" whenever Laurel and Hardy would do something to agitate him.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a000431">Pringles</h3>

<p>The first case we discussed on the first day (today) of my introductory marketing class was Pringles. Development on Pringles started in the 50's when P&amp;G saw an opportunity for a national brand to "beat-up smaller and less sophisticated competitors". At the time the potato chip market was dominated by local producers because of the product's limited shelf life and frailty in transit. P&amp;G hoped to solve those problems with the round aluminum can and a product designed to have a shelf life of one year.</p>
<p>When Pringles was finally released in 1968 it quickly rose to 25% market share due to heavy trials but soon dropped to 7% because of few repeat purchases. Our professor's justification for the lack of repeat buyers was that customers 'inferred' an artificial taste from the strange packaging and year-long shelf life. My hand was raised but the professor never called on me, so I'll make my point here.</p>
<p>How could you assume that customers thought the taste was artificial <i>because of the packaging and shelf life</i>? Could it be that they actually looked at the ingredients and saw for themselves just how engineered the product was? Is this how marketing thinks - that there is no 'truth', only perception?</p>
<p>Pringles was discontinued in 1978, but as we all know became extremely successful in the 1980's and is now a $1b business. You could argue that I'm wrong, that consumers are now accustomed to strange packaging and potato chips with a half-life of one year. I think tastes have changed. In the potato chip aisle at Ralph's today, Pringles just might be the <i>least</i> artificial product available.</p>

<h2>October 20, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a000427">Thanks Breean</h3>

<p>I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399149244/qid=1066705771/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-8704394-6014318?v=glance&amp;s=books">Tricky Business</a> [amazon.com] today. It's Dave Barry's second novel, the first being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399145672/ref=pd_sim_books_1/104-8704394-6014318?v=glance&amp;s=books">Big Trouble</a>. I liked that also but Tricky Business is more humorous and I'd say more polished.</p>
<p>Dave (I have a hard time referring by last name to someone who writes about boogers 95% of the time) has defined and absolutely perfected the Miami crime drama. It's about dumb criminals, corrupt politicians and unlikely heroes. And boogers. What more could you ask for?</p>

<h3 id="a000426">Sharks with frickin' laser beams</h3>

<p>Remember <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/">Real Genius</a> with Val Kilmer? The climactic scene shows the government bad guys trying to use a satellite-mounted laser  to kill someone. Apparently this is <a href="http://www.oaklandtribune.com/cda/article/print/0,1674,82%257E1865%257E1709759,00.html">now for real</a> [from <a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a>].</p>
<p>In the movie Val and his cohorts are able to save the day and redirect the laser towards a house full of corn kernels, making their evil professor look stupid and discrediting any military purpose the technology might have. Where is our real-life hero?</p>

<h3 id="a000423">Lazy living</h3>

<p>We just finished <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0301727/">Winged Migration</a> on pay-per-view. I love the scene in the Amazon where a macaw (heck, I don't know what it is) unfastens the latch on his cage and flies away. This movies gives you a real appreciation for the intelligence of birds. And the scenery and cinematography are amazing. Breean likes it so much she <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2003/10/19/index.html#000422">wants to be a bird</a>.</p>

<p>Apple introduces <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes for Windoze</a>. If anyone tries it out please let me know what you think. My guess is they'll capture the market pretty quickly.

<p>Why wasn't <a href=&#8221;http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html&#8221;>The West Wing</a> on tonight? I&rsquo;m hooked on it now.</p>
<p>What does it say about us when a TV show about politics is more &lsquo;political&rsquo; than the Davis recall campaign?</p>
<p>As Penni points out in her comment, she definitely deserves all the credit (blame) for getting me hooked on the show.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/12RICH.html?pagewanted=all&position=">The Audio-Animatronic Candidate</a> The Terminator brings Disney politics to life:
<blockquote>
The candidate's "town meetings" were open to invited guests only. (Not even a game show retains such tight control of its extras.) Until the final days, "meeting the press" meant spurning the actual press entirely for TV entertainers like Oprah and Jay Leno. Political "dialogue" for Mr. Schwarzenegger meant dialogue akin to that of actors in costume playing Disney cartoon characters: he plucked well-worn tag lines from his films and shuffled them into crowd-pleasing medleys of his greatest hits. A debate? The only one he attended allowed him to deliver more scripted lines, written in response to questions provided in advance; he mouthed them with all the spontaneity mustered by "Abe Lincoln" at the Hall of Presidents in Orlando.

Biologists should learn from life's existential quandaries, he says, but many do not. Instead, they sweep the difficulties under the rug of "adaptationism," the notion that everything about an animal's body and behavior has been honed to enhance its "fitness" or chance of passing on genes.<br/>
...<br/>
Dr. Ryan calls this "sensory exploitation" &#8212; a new behavior that succeeds in evolution because it takes advantage of existing ways of perceiving the world. The same principle causes a female fish of the swordtail species to prefer males with "swords" extending from their bodies. The swords fit the existing tuning of the fish visual system, inherited from some ancestor. A related species, the platyfish, has no swords. But when a male platyfish has a sword sewn onto his tail, platyfish females prefer him.

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=541&amp;e=2&amp;u=/ap/low_carb_mystery">Low-Carb Diets Are Working, Study Says</a>:
<blockquote>
(The study) found that people eating an extra 300 calories a day on a very low-carb regimen lost just as much during a 12-week study as those on a standard lowfat diet.<br/>
...<br/>
 The study was unique because all the food was prepared at an upscale Italian restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., so researchers knew exactly what they ate. Most earlier studies simply sent people home with diet plans to follow as best they could.<br/>
<br/>
Each afternoon, the volunteers picked up that evening's dinner, a bedtime snack and the next day's breakfast and lunch. Instead of lots of red meat and saturated fat, which many find disturbing about low-carb diets, these people ate mostly fish, chicken, salads, vegetables and unsaturated oils. </blockquote>

<h3 id="a000396">Why do many fast-food restaurants promise a free meal if you are not given a receipt?</h3>

<p>Because Google seems <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Why%20do%20many%20fast-food%20restaurants%20promise%20a%20free%20meal%20if%20you%20are%20not%20given%20a%20receipt?">not to know the answer</a> I thought I'd post my last microecon essay here.</p>

<p>What possible benefit could a restaurant see from giving away meals to customers not given a receipt?  The potential goodwill generated between the restaurant and a lucky customer would likely have some benefit in increased future visits; whether this distant payoff is worth the meal cost or not is doubtful.</p>

<p>The policy is in fact designed to provide incentives for customers to verify the accuracy of a cashier’s work.  Without such a policy, cashiers are free to skim the cash receipts - to charge for food or drinks without booking the item, pocketing the difference.  Managers of fast-food restaurants are far too busy to monitor every cashier on every transaction.  Nor is it feasible for them to match inventory to activity at any individual register.</p>

<p>Once given a receipt, customers will naturally verify its accuracy for the purely self-interested desire to not be overcharged.  Noticing that she paid for a 99¢ soda not on the receipt, at least some percentage of customers will bring it to the attention of the cashier (attracting management) or, recognizing the situation, talk directly with the store manager.</p>

<p>Considering that the cost of free meals is probably taken directly from the cashier’s salary, this policy provides a free, inobtrusive and effective mechanism for management to prevent employee theft.</p>

<h3 id="a000389">Heard from another student in econ</h3>

<p>Ithaca, NY has a <a href="http://www.tompkins-co.org/solidwaste/trashtag.html">strange trash policy</a>. Instead of paying increased taxes to pay for trash services, residents are required to buy $2 'trash tags' from city hall and stick these on each trash can every trash day. The purpose is 1) to reduce overall trash by inducing people to recycle; and 2) to insure everyone pays for the amount of trash they actually produce.</p>
<p>There's one interesting side effect though. You'll notice that - especially in areas with a lot of students - public trash cans are often overflowing. To avoid paying the two bucks many people try to dump household trash in public places. To compensate some public trash cans have signs that say: "No household trash."</p>

<h3 id="a000374">Fear of the cold call</h3>

<p>B-schools often use the cold call as a motivational tool. The idea is that students will prepare for class or face the risk of getting called on and looking stupid in front of the entire class. At Cornell, at least in my accounting and econ classes, this tool has already lost much of its weight.</p>
<p>With only ~250 people in our class, we've all gotten to know one another at least to some degree. To the point where - at least - you know that pretty much everybody is not a complete moron. And that's where the cold call loses its effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you know that nobody is a moron, and you know that everybody knows that you're not a moron, the fear of looking like an idiot loses its effectiveness. In accounting and econ <i>everybody</i> is guaranteed to look stupid at one point or another, and we all know it. So there's no shame in it.</p>
