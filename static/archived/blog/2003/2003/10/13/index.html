<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=541&amp;e=2&amp;u=/ap/low_carb_mystery">Low-Carb Diets Are Working, Study Says</a>:
<blockquote>
(The study) found that people eating an extra 300 calories a day on a very low-carb regimen lost just as much during a 12-week study as those on a standard lowfat diet.<br/>
...<br/>
 The study was unique because all the food was prepared at an upscale Italian restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., so researchers knew exactly what they ate. Most earlier studies simply sent people home with diet plans to follow as best they could.<br/>
<br/>
Each afternoon, the volunteers picked up that evening's dinner, a bedtime snack and the next day's breakfast and lunch. Instead of lots of red meat and saturated fat, which many find disturbing about low-carb diets, these people ate mostly fish, chicken, salads, vegetables and unsaturated oils. </blockquote>

<h3 id="a000396">Why do many fast-food restaurants promise a free meal if you are not given a receipt?</h3>

<p>Because Google seems <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Why%20do%20many%20fast-food%20restaurants%20promise%20a%20free%20meal%20if%20you%20are%20not%20given%20a%20receipt?">not to know the answer</a> I thought I'd post my last microecon essay here.</p>

<p>What possible benefit could a restaurant see from giving away meals to customers not given a receipt?  The potential goodwill generated between the restaurant and a lucky customer would likely have some benefit in increased future visits; whether this distant payoff is worth the meal cost or not is doubtful.</p>

<p>The policy is in fact designed to provide incentives for customers to verify the accuracy of a cashier’s work.  Without such a policy, cashiers are free to skim the cash receipts - to charge for food or drinks without booking the item, pocketing the difference.  Managers of fast-food restaurants are far too busy to monitor every cashier on every transaction.  Nor is it feasible for them to match inventory to activity at any individual register.</p>

<p>Once given a receipt, customers will naturally verify its accuracy for the purely self-interested desire to not be overcharged.  Noticing that she paid for a 99¢ soda not on the receipt, at least some percentage of customers will bring it to the attention of the cashier (attracting management) or, recognizing the situation, talk directly with the store manager.</p>

<p>Considering that the cost of free meals is probably taken directly from the cashier’s salary, this policy provides a free, inobtrusive and effective mechanism for management to prevent employee theft.</p>

<p>I'm looking to sell my digital camera.  I do not need it any longer, as I am in the hospital.  I am including the last photo that I took with it so you have some idea about the picture quality.</p>

<h3 id="a000394">A warm and friendly NASA</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,60798,00.html">Touchy-Feely NASA Effort</a>: "Two NASA reformers try to create a warmer culture after the Columbia probe suggests engineers are too intimidated to speak up about hunches that have proved deadly. Not everybody agrees with the fuzzy approach."</p>
<p>We discussed NASA and the Columbia disaster in one of my classes recently. It was pretty clear that upper management at NASA has real problems reacting appropriately to bad news. But how much can only <i>two people</i> accomplish?</p>

<h3 id="a000393">I hope these are entirely unrelated</h3>

<p><a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20031013/0050207.shtml">Technology Therapy For Computer Illiterate Executives</a>:
<blockquote>
These old time execs realize that computer skills are important, but feel silly going to basic training classes and sitting in with "the masses". So, computer "therapists" are showing up, promising to teach these old timers how to use their computers quietly so that no one knows they're seeking help.

<p>From the always-reliable <a href="http://www.nypost.com/gossip/pagesix.htm">New York Post gossip column</a>: 'funnyman Rodney Dangerfield has met with members of the alien-obsessed Raelian cult about cloning himself...  "Rodney and I are clone-curious," Joan Dangerfield told us. "Rodney said he'd like a clone to help him write jokes... Rodney and I remain skeptical," Joan says. "But if the ethical and legal concerns could be met, I would start painting our spare room blue."'</p>
