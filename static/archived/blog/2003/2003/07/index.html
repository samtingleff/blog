<h3 id="a000333">Best news I've heard in a long time</h3>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=573&amp;ncid=964&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/odd_pizza_dc">Pizza Cuts Cancer Risk?</a>: "Researchers at a Milan pharmacology center found that eating one or more pizzas a week dramatically reduced the incidence of some types of cancer. 
A study of 8,000 Italians found that regular pizza-eaters were 59 percent less likely to contract cancer of the esophagus, while the risk of developing cancer of the colon fell by 26 percent."</p>

<h3 id="a000332">Nevermind moving next weekend</h3>

<p>Mexico City is currently the <a href="http://www.mongabay.com/cities_pop_01.htm">third largest 'urban area' in the world</a>, with 29.8 million residents (depending on <a href="http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/bigcities.htm">how you count</a> and <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/north_america/mexico_city/">whom you believe</a>). It is stricken with poverty and has some of the <a href="http://www.ess.co.at/GAIA/CASES/MEX/">worst air pollution</a> anywhere. There's even a <a href="http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/popoca_i.html">volcano</a> that could go off. But it has to be better than Moline, IL.</p>
<p>The weeks plans have changed. I'll be spending my last week with SAP giving a customer demo in Mexico City rather than... doing nothing in Moline. I've bugged my manager for months to send me to South America for <i>something</i>. Mexico City may not be <a href="http://www.ipanema.com/">Rio</a>, heck it's not even in <i>Central</i> America, but it will be an adventure. Back Friday</p>

Sunnyvale, San Jose and Daly City are also on the list (though near the bottom).</p>

<h3 id="a000323">It's very strange leaving a</h3>

<p>It's very strange leaving a company by your own free will. There's no hard feelings, no security guards waiting, no outplacement counseling. I feel like I'm getting divorced. It is a divorce in a way. The longer I was with SAP the more the job became part of my identity, part of who I am. Most of the time I didn't like that feeling.</p>
<p>And that's one reason I'm leaving. <a href="http://www.sapteched.com/edu_sessions/speakerInfo.asp?Spkid=512" title="My very brief SAP bio">This</a> is not who I am. Where am I going from here? Who knows. But it's going to be fun. Not knowing sounds a lot better to me right now than another XX years of corporate life.</p>

<h3 id="a000321">Unfortunately Squaw was closed</h3>

<p>I had a great time in Tahoe with Breean's family over the weekend. They were all very nice to me and a lot of fun to be around. The fireworks Friday (below) were great.</p>
<p>Saturday we rented three-person <a href="http://www.ski-doo.com/">Ski-Doos</a> on the lake and terrorized the wildlife. Meagan somehow managed to flip it completely upside-down, throwing us into the 60&#x00B0; water.</p>
<p>On the drive back the girls wanted to stop in Truckee to shop so I had a nice (long) one-on-one with Meagan's bearded dragon. I'm starting to like the little guy.</p>

<h3 id="a000320">Craigslist rules</h3>

<p>Does anyone still use the newspaper classified adds to find used cars? I've got mine <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/car/13124093.html">listed on craigslist</a> and <a href="http://www.autotrader.com/findacar/vdetail.jtmpl?car_id=135443777&amp;dealer_id=&amp;car_year=1996&amp;make=MIT&amp;distance=25&amp;max_price=8000&amp;model=ECLIP&amp;advcd_on=n&amp;end_year=1997&amp;min_price=4500&amp;certified=n&amp;address=94043&amp;search_type=used&amp;advanced=n&amp;start_year=1995&amp;color=&amp;cardist=0">on autotrader.com</a>, is the newspaper really necessary?</p>
<p>It seems to me that online listings offer so many advantages (searching, no ridiculous word limit, photos, etc.) over newspaper classifieds that nobody would use anything else any more.</p>
