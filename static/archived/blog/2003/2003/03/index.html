 Small and mid-sized businesses looking to automate office functions got another option to evaluate as SAP AG on Thursday introduced its Business One software suite in the United States.

Business One is already in use by 1,300 customers in Europe. I'm curious to see how it will sell here.</p>

<h3 id="a000230">Turns out I had good</h3>

<p>Turns out I had good reason to be scared of the food at the Disney Coronado Springs. Not that it made anyone sick, just that it was really, really bad. This resort is a $15 taxi ride away from anything else so we were stuck with the two on-site restaurants. I decided that Disney's strategy is to keep the kids happy at all costs and not spend any effort on parents.</p>
<p>My other complaint is that the resort gym is "<i>membership based</i>", meaning it costs $15 per day or $25 for your entire stay. For $15 I expect a huge gym with a full spa and a masseuse. Three treadmills, a few machines and some dumbells were all I got.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I was scheduled to co-present on web services at SAP. 15 minutes before the start time my laptop croaked. First it crashed and I had to do a hard shutdown. Then it absolutely refused to start back up. Fortunately they had a spare laptop ready with our presentation available, I just couldn't do the online demos we had planned.</p>

<h3 id="a000228">On CNN Headline News this</h3>

<p>On CNN Headline News this afternoon they asked what I thought was a very odd question: "Are reports from embedded journalists detrimental to the war effort?" The question was based on the assumption that these journalists provide an "inside scoop" into coalition troops. CNN wonders if these reporters somehow provide too much information, possibly giving Iraq additional insight into U.S. military strategy.</p>

<h3 id="a000224">Hopefully we won't have any meetings on the teacups</h3>

<p>I'm flying to Orlando <strike>tomorrow</strike> today for the <a href="http://www.sapbwportals2003.com/">SAP BW and Portals conference</a>. Trust me when I say that I know as much about BW and Portals as you, dear readers, are likely to know. Yet somehow I'm on the hook for two presentations.</p>
<p>The last estimates I heard were that around 1,500 people are signed up and only 10-20 had canceled due to current events. With 5-8 sessions per time slot we're looking at 200-300 people per session. The largest audience I've spoken to is about 80 people. This will definitely be an experience.</p>
<p>I'm staying at the <a href="http://www.disney.ca/vacations/disneyworld/II/B/5/">Disney Coronado Springs Resort</a>, which is proudly "themed to regions of Mexico and the American Southwest." Never mind my feelings about Disney - should I be scared to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/TRAVEL/11/30/disney.sick.cruise/">eat the food</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
In a few hours we are going to see the second major test of the Bush doctrine as we invade Iraq.  Its first test (a vote in favor of war in Iraq by the UN) failed miserably.  Amazingly, most people don't even know about the Bush doctrine and what it entails.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>This is something I want to see from the administration. The world has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=United+States+long+term+strategy+against+terrorism">yet to see</a> a clear outline of the long term Bush strategy. If we're expected to blindly support the administration on the assumption that they know more than we do (and this seems to be the message from the White House), I think we at least deserve to see the strategy.</p>
<p>My guess is that most of the country would not like what they saw.</p>

<p>Update: SAP confirms rumors, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/djus/030313/1620001035_1.html">Kagermann to become sole CEO</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030313/tech_sap_1.html">SAP CEO Plattner to step down</a>. We've seen rumors of this several times in the last few months and SAP always denied them. He's been in charge of the company for 30 years. I hope this doesn't hurt our stock too much.</p>
<p>The big question now is who will replace Plattner. There's <a href="http://crn.channelsupersearch.com/news/crn/39684.asp">one obvious answer</a> but he's young (would piss off other board members) and not even German. But in my time at SAP I've never seen Shai Agassi lose a single battle. Then there's the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20020802S0004">safe answer</a>, Henning Kagermann.

<h3 id="a000204">Nicholas Kristof has an NYT</h3>

<p>Nicholas Kristof has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/opinion/04KRIS.html">NYT column</a> today on the rise of Evangelical Christianity in America:
<blockquote>
President Bush has said that he doesn't believe in evolution (he thinks the jury is still out). President Ronald Reagan felt the same way, and such views are typically American. A new Gallup poll shows that 48 percent of Americans believe in creationism, and only 28 percent in evolution (most of the rest aren't sure or lean toward creationism). According to recent Gallup Tuesday briefings, Americans are more than twice as likely to believe in the devil (68 percent) as in evolution.

<h3 id="a000203">Everybody wants to know how this differs from her official version</h3>

<p>It was interesting to read a journalist's <a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/psychohistory/read/message.html?sort=d&amp;mid=1711891071&amp;start=4389">unofficial take</a> on the World Economic Forum:
<blockquote>
- I was in a dinner with heads of Saudi and German FBI, plus the foreign minister of Afghanistan. They all said that at its peak Al Qaeda had 70,000 members. Only 10% of them were trained in terrorism -- the rest were military recruits. Of that 7000, they say all but about 200 are dead or in jail.<br/>
- But Al Qaeda, they say, is like a brand which has been heavily franchised. And nobody knows how many unofficial franchises have been spawned since 9/11.<br/>
- The global economy is in very very very very bad shape. Last year when WEF met here in New York all I heard was, "Yeah, it's bad, but recovery is right around the corner".<br/>
- Not surprisingly, the business community was in no mood to hear about a war in Iraq.

<h3 id="a000202">Blair on Climate Change</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Blair gave a <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page3073.asp">significant speech</a> yesterday on sustainable development. May (sic) analysts have pointed out that his fine words have not been adequately reinforced by the energy white paper that was also released yesterday.</p>
<p>"It is clear Kyoto is not radical enough. But it is at the moment the most that is politically achievable. And even the Kyoto targets have proved controversial with some countries, notably America. Many see it as a threat to the pursuit of economic growth. I believe this needn't be the case. If we harness new technology the evidence is mounting that we can achieve a target of 60% -- and at reasonable cost."

<h3 id="a000201">Advisors tell Bush climate plan</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,903609,00.html?=rss">Advisors tell Bush climate plan is useless</a>:
<blockquote>
George Bush's strategy on global warming suffered a setback yesterday when a panel of scientists convened at the request of the White House condemned it as lacking vision, and wasting time and money on research questions that were resolved years ago...<br/><br/>
The 17 environmental experts, assembled by the National Academy of Sciences at the president's request, said in their report that the president's strategy "lacks most of the basic elements of a strategic plan: a guiding vision, executable goals, clear timetables and criteria for measuring progress", and misses the opportunity to cooperate more with other countries on research.<br/>
