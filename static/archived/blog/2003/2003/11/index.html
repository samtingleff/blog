<h3 id="a000512">Only $80?</h3>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_11_01_archive.html#107014205225484373">DNA sequencing for children</a>: "Discovery toys is selling an $80 toy called the <a href="http://shopping.discovery.com/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10000&storeId=10000&productId=53965&langId=-1&search=Y&searchKey=1362624583">DNA Explorer</a>, which allows small children to extract and sequence the DNA from a variety of foodstuffs." That's a long way from the chemistry set I used to have.</p>
<p>There's gotta be some devious, sinister way to use this thing (sharks with frickin' laser beams?) and you can bet some kid in suburbia somewhere will figure out how.</p>

<h3 id="a000508">We've got leftover Turkey for months</h3>

<p>There are benefits to cooking Thanksgiving dinner at your own house. Eating pumpkin pie at four in the afternoon, for example. I didn't have to fight with Derrick and David for leftover sweet potatoes or rolls. I could make the sweet potato stuff with 10% potatoes and 90% brown sugar, pecans and marshmallows. And we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325703/">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life</a> with dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner was great - Breean has <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2003/11/27/index.html#000507">photos</a> of the grub. But I forgot the cranberry sauce. And it's just not the same without the family.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_11_01_archive.html#106995309923762572">Big Thunder Mountain broken by negligence</a>:
<blockquote>
Looks like the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/6977310.htm">fatal crash on Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain</a> was the result of poor maintenance. Disneyland's maintenance has been suffering ever since a group of McKinsey and ex-McKinsey consultants advised them to save money by cutting back on preventative maintenance and forcing out experienced, senior cast-members. Management consultants: is there anything they can't screw up?

<h2>November 23, 2003</h2>


<h3 id="a000495">This is the best: "Approach versus 'Being Approachable'"</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> had two memos recently published on <a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/">Internalmemos.com</a>. No dates are provided though, so I'm going to assume they were released relatively close to each other.
<ol>
 <li>"<a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1391">Reshaping Our Workforce</a>", in which the CEO says that 1% of the total workforce will be laid off.</li>
 <li>"<a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1734">Creating an Environment of Retention</a>", in which the Asia Pacific CEO discusses the problem of top performer retention.</li>
</ol>
The second memo is a bunch of bs about "Leadership Survey Results" and "the 'Five for Five' Rule," never mentioning the real problem (see memo # 1).</p>
<p>This reminds me of my first week on the job at <a href="/static/html/praja.html">Praja</a>. Walking through the hall I saw a friend from school who had worked there part-time for several years. He was there to get a letter of recommendation from the CEO for his application to the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>. He said to me, "Sam, I think all the smart people left already." He got in, BTW, and now <strike>works on</strike> <i>runs</i> the <a href="http://opengov.media.mit.edu/">Government Information Awareness</a> project.</p>
<p>A month and a half later I was <a href="/static/html/praja2.html">thrown to the curb</a> along with 70% of the company.</p>

<h3 id="a000491">My favorite quote: "Power isn't fun anymore"</h3>

<p>From Washingtonpost.com: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63887-2003Nov19.html">The Slough of Uncertainty</a> [from <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/">bubblegeneration</a>]. The nature of power in business is changing, and if your company <a href="2003/11/01/index.html#000456">doesn't understand</a> the implications, it's in <a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com/">big trouble</a>. I don't like the CBS example though. Maybe it's just because of my political sensibility, but I think that's just a case of Big Media's extreme gutlessness.
<blockquote>
The corporate executives who preside over these empires are questioning all the rules they've lived by. Bigness, for instance. For CEOs, bigness turns out to mean that they have to spend their days managing downward -- communicating with increasingly remote and baffled employees, trying to explain why certain decisions haven't been made.
<br/>
In the era of Internet blogs, all memos are leaked, which only adds to executive insecurity. Businesses today swim in a rancid scum of aired feelings. One lone guy at a PC keyboard loosed the right-wing Web warriors who brought mighty CBS to its knees over the Reagan miniseries. CEOs can no longer kid themselves they are admired and fearless leaders -- and if they cherish any such delusions, a visit to the company chat room will quickly cure them.
<br/>
...<br/>
"Power isn't fun anymore," one financial services honcho told me at a function the other night. "You can't do anything by fiat."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
One interesting finding is that although both large and small companies do better under Democratic administrations, small companies do especially well, while larger ones do only a little better. The return on the smallest 10 percent of traded companies is 21 percent higher during Democratic administrations, while the return on the largest 10 percent is only 7.7 percent greater.

Of course they have absolutely no idea why this might be true, and neither do I.

<h3 id="a000489">Sam's Wal-Mart watch</h3>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/19/news/companies/walmart_toys/index.htm?cnn=yes">Wal-Mart kicks off toy price war</a>:
<blockquote>
The Wall Street Journal reports that a survey conducted by Banc of America Securities found that Wal-Mart's prices of 15 popular toys were 12 percent lower than those of Toys "R" Us.<br/>
...<br/>
And it reported that some of Wal-Mart's retail prices are below wholesale prices. For instance, it is charging $29.74 for the Hot Wheels T-Wrecks Play Set, which has a wholesale price of $42, and $19.46 for the Sesame Street Hokey Pokey Elmo, whose wholesale price is $24.
</blockquote>
Toys "R" Us is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TOY&d=t">down 2.65%</a> today alone after posting a quarterly loss of 18 cents per share. They're in big trouble.

<h3 id="a000488">A little pressure</h3>

<p>Somehow I made it through eight chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0324264534/ref=lpr_g_1/002-6592898-7612055?v=glance&s=books">statistics</a> this afternoon. I've had an exceedingly difficult time concentrating on it until today (midterm tomorrow).</p>
<p>I wish the professor brought in some real-world examples to bring this stuff to life. I'd like to hear about real disasters caused by faulty studies or poor statistical interpretation. Without that, this class is <i>dry</i>.</p>

Economist <a href=&#8221;http://www.wws.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/&#8221;>Paul Krugman</a> gives a solid rundown of the current mutual fund scandal, quoting <a href=&#8221;http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/levitt.htm&#8221;>Arthur Levitt</a> who calls it &#8220;the worst scandal we've seen in 50 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s right this is going to get a lot worse. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of institutional money flowing out mutuals, and with prices dropping the common folk will probably start to sell as well.

<h3 id="a000486">Saving Private Lynch</h3>

<p>Jessica Lynch, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;call_pageid=971358637177&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1068937808710">From hero, to whistle-blower, to celebrity</a>:
<blockquote>
Lynch is also a mite angry about the Pentagon's manipulation of events and can't seem to stop correcting the record.
<br/>
She says she never got off a shot because her gun jammed. The Iraqi medical staff were kindness itself. She was out cold for three hours after her Humvee crashed in the grenade attack, so she doesn't remember any sexual assault. And shocked Iraqi doctors deny it.
<br/>
As for the dramatic, Rambo-style hospital raid on April 1, she says there was no resistance, no Iraqi military in the hospital, and staff even offered the rescuers a key.
<br/>
The Pentagon "used me to symbolize all this stuff," Lynch told a fawning Diane Sawyer on ABC last week. "It's wrong."
</blockquote>
Naturally the Pentagon and the media (okay, which deserves more blame?) want to put her in the 'rescued hero' box and use the miraculous rescue script we're all so familiar with. But it doesn't fit. And until today I didn't even know.

<h3 id="a000480">The Wal-Mart you don't know</h3>

<p>Fast Company describes <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html">The Wal-Mart You Don't Know</a>:
<blockquote>
On basic products that don't change, the price Wal-Mart will pay, and will charge shoppers, must drop year after year. But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and its 21,000 suppliers knows is the high cost of those low prices. Wal-Mart has the power to squeeze profit-killing concessions from vendors. To survive in the face of its pricing demands, makers of everything from bras to bicycles to blue jeans have had to lay off employees and close U.S. plants in favor of outsourcing products from overseas.<br/>
...<br/>
Last year, 7.5 cents of every dollar spent in any store in the United States (other than auto-parts stores) went to the retailer. That means a contract with Wal-Mart can be critical even for the largest consumer-goods companies. Dial Corp., for example, does 28% of its business with Wal-Mart.
</blockquote>
The consequences are clearly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6513-2003Nov5.html">not only about losing jobs</a>. But with consumers unwilling to shop elsewhere  at higher prices, and suppliers forced to... supply, what can you do?

<p>Sam's first real lesson from b-school: if you really want something done, don't use email. Most people are too busy and too overloaded with meaningless 'stuff' and junk mail to pay attention to anything important. Not really news, but it hadn't fully hit home with me till now.</p>

<h3 id="a000473">Not the first time I've learned from Dave</h3>

<p>I learned something new from <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/7217432.htm">Dave Barry</a> today. Many office thermostats are <a href="http://www.careerjournal.com/columnists/cubicleculture/20030117-cubicle.html">fakes</a>!</p>
<p>Heating in large buildings is usually controlled by a few sadists in the basement, with non-functioning thermostats positioned throughout the building to keep the minions happy. Dave points out that most office workers are similarly effective.</p>
<p>And those 'close door' buttons in elevators don't do anything unless you're a fireman or operator with special access.

<h3 id="a000472">First large study of social vc investments</h3>

<p>From HBS: <a href="http://www.hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3774&t=nonprofit">The Hard Numbers on Social Investments</a> [from <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/">SAP Ventures</a>]. Harvard b-school students analyzed the financial returns of 110 early-stage investments by <a href="http://www.investorscircle.net/">Investors' Circle</a>, a VC "intermediary whose mission is to support early-stage, private companies that drive the transition to a sustainable economy."</p>
<p>They looked at 110 out of 128 investments from 1992 to 2001, seeking to determine whether social investments can provide positive returns. The answer, in classic MBA fashion, is "it depends."</p>
<p>Keys to success were similar to traditional VC money: "Those in the top quartile invested in four times as many companies as those in the lowest quartile and participated in 40 percent more rounds of company financing as compared to all other investors." The problem was liquidity.</p>

<h3 id="a000469">Snow!</h3>

<p>I went to NYC Thursday night with the <a href="http://www.jgsmconsulting.com/">Johnson Consulting Club</a>. We spent the night at the Helmsley Windsor on West 58th (good location, nice rooms, horrible breakfast, overpriced). Then visited <a href="http://www.ibm.com/services/">IBM Business Consulting Services</a>, <a href="http://www.dc.com/">Deloitte Consulting</a> and the <a href=http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/page/0,1641,16286,00.asp">American Express Strategic Planning and Business Development Group</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>Of the three the Amex was easily my favorite, for the actual work, the lifestyle (less travel) and 'cultural fit'. Amex is the only job I've seen through on-campus recruiting that I would actually take. If only it were 1999 and they had to beg me to take the job, rather than the other way around. Maybe by the time I graduate.</p>
<p>We arrived back in Ithaca at one in the morning Saturday, and I swear it was 20 degrees colder than when I left. It was easily 10 degrees colder than the city.</p>
<p>Saturday morning we woke up to light snow - the first of the year. It was beautiful.</p>

<h3 id="a000465">Wal-Mart is doomed</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6513-2003Nov5.html">Stores Follow Wal-Mart's Lead in Labor</a> [from <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/">bubblegeneration</a>]:
<blockquote>
Wal-Mart's mania for selling goods at rock-bottom prices has trained consumers to expect deep discounts everywhere they shop, forcing competing retailers to follow suit or fall behind.<br/>
The Oct. 23 arrest of 250 illegal aliens working for outside cleaning crews at 61 Wal-Mart stores nationwide underscores another aspect of Wal-Mart's low-price formula: a fervent effort to hold down labor costs. This week the retailer said it has received a "target letter" from a federal grand jury in Pennsylvania, signifying that Wal-Mart itself is under investigation for its role in using illegal workers.<br/>
Part of the reason the chain is able to offer a microwave oven for under $30 or a 24-can package of Sam's Choice cola for $3.64 or a gas-powered lawn mower for under $150, for instance, is because it contracts with outside janitorial services -- some of which have questionable hiring practices -- and relies heavily on lower-paid part-time workers, say unions and competitors.
</blockquote>
Wal-Mart will see an increasing number of scandals as a consequence of their solitary focus on price. They'll try to blame everything on contractors or suppliers - will that legal/PR strategy be successful?

<p>If you remember the <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF19">fifth episode</a> of <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodeguide/season11.html">season 11</a>, you'll remember how Homer and Bart conjured up a plant they called 'Tomacco'. It was an addictive cross between tobacco and tomato, and everything from cows to pigs (Chief Wiggum) went crazy for it.</p>

<h3 id="a000457">Not that there's anything wrong with washing dishes</h3>

<p>WSJ.com says that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB106729501444224900,00.html?mod=us_business_biz_focus_hs">employers are now asking for SAT scores</a>, primarily for entry-level jobs in financial services and investment banking. My god, that's even worse than using undergraduate grades.</p>
<p>B-schools see the same behavior from elitist consulting firms and i-banks. I've decided that there is a purpose to it. If an employer makes it known that they require a specific GPA/test score/etc., I don't have to waste my time researching them as a potential employer. "Cultural fit" is their term, I believe.</p>
<p>Of course with an attitude like that I'll probably end up washing dishes at Applebee's next summer.</p>

<h3 id="a000456">More on the job market</h3>

<p>Interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/28/business/businessspecial/28CONN.html">piece</a> in the NY Times about conflict in the workplace between Gen X/Y (18-34) and their older counterparts. The establishment complains that "the things they ask us about are benefits, rewards and career opportunities - the things that impact 'me' - rather than where are we going to be as a company in 10 to 15 years."</p>
<p>But of course nobody under 35 (does anybody over 35?) expects to be with the same company for nearly that long. Why? It's a "sophisticated response to a workplace that operates without the myth of job security."</p>
<p>There's also complaints that for "Gen X'ers, everything is apparently open for negotiation," frequently over work-life balance. Again, sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>My question is how business and the economy will change <i>when we're in charge?</i></p>
