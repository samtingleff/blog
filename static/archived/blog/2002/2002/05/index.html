<p>I read in the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/bayarea/">merc</a> today that Palo Alto public schools are testing organic food for school lunches.  That's good news.  But what kid will voluntarily eat <i>chickenless nuggets</i>?</p>
<p>I'm looking for a Windoze-based photo slide show app.  Any ideas?  I've got a growing collection of digital photos and I need a convenient way to browse and display them.  The MS photo editor just does not cut it.</p>

<p>Update:  <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~smann/webvision/">VisionViewer 3</a> [Java] is free and works well once you figure out the (ugly) UI.  It won't do a full screen slide show though.</p>

<p>Does anyone else use it for work purposes?  USA Today says it's a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2002/05/29/im-security.htm">security risk</a>.  Network admins think anything they don't have the power to screw up is a risk.</p>

<h3 id="a000025">There's a funny article on</h3>

<p>There's a funny article on <a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon</a> today about <a href="http://salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/05/15/online_dating/index.html">online dating</a>.  The basic idea is that online singles are all packaged as brands to be consumed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.match.com/">Match.com</a> says that paid subscribers are up 195 percent from last year.  Salon says to "talk to any youngish single person in New York."  Don't think any of my friends are doing this.  Not that I know of anyway.  <i>Chris</i>?  How about doing an experiment for tingleff.com?</p>
<p>Also on Salon today is a (negative) <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2002/05/16/attack_clones/index1.html">review</a> of <i>Attack of the Clones</i>.  About <a href="http://www.jarjarsucks.com/">Jar Jar</a>:  "for what it's worth, the preview audience I saw the movie with hissed when he came on-screen and cheered when he left."</p>

<h3 id="a000023">Another Cingular complaint... When I</h3>

<p>Another Cingular complaint...</p>
<p>When I call my voice mail number from a phone that is <i>not</i> my cell phone, the friendly female voice - the kind that says "your call is important to us" when clearly it is not - tells me that for 'security reasons' I must call from my Cingular wireless cell phone.</p>
<p>I e-mailed <a href="https://www.cingular.com/customer_service/contact_us">customer support</a> to request that this ability be enabled somehow.  I told them that I understood the security implications but that many subscribers would probably sacrifice some security for the convenience.  I also indicated my suspicion that the true reason is to extract more airtime from subscribers.</p>
<p>The response was this: "In order to check your voice mail from a regular phone you will need to subscribe to our Enhanced Voicemail service, which is $4.99 per month."</p>
<p>I can understand that they want the revenue.  But don't lie to me.</p>

<p>Sounds like Bush and Putin wanted some PR before Bush's first trip to Russia.  The Times calls it "an agreement filled with escape clauses."</p>

<h3 id="a000020">Global services jobs migrate to</h3>

<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/020509/telecoms_india_services_1.html">Global services jobs migrate to India via Internet</a> [Yahoo].</p>
<p>This is the world vision coming from the multinationals.  Labor moves to the cheapest possible location and management remains in the comfort of a "high-income country" reaping the profits.  Jobs that require "modest to moderate intelligence" (from the article) will move to India and those that require... (less than "moderate intelligence"?) will move to third-world countries.</p>
<p>I think it's obvious that this is not good for anyone in the long term.</p>
<p>Does the left have an a clear alternative?  I don't see it.  There are isolated anti-globalization and environmental movements, but where is the cohesive long-term outlook?  Does anyone have a 20 or 50 year plan for sustainable business?</p>
