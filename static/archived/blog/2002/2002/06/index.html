<h3 id="a000042">CNN: Pledge of Allegiance ruled</h3>

<p>CNN:  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/26/pledge.allegiance/index.html">Pledge of Allegiance ruled unconstitutional</a></p>
<p>Bush has already come out against this ruling and the Republicans will probably turn it into an election issue.  Here's my take:</p>
<p>Most Americans would disagree with the ruling.  Politicians will follow the money and the majority - against the court.  <i>This is why we have the court system.</i></p>
<p>The courts are responsible for interpreting the Constitution.  The courts protect the minority from the majority when the executive and legislative branches will not do so.</p>
<p>And in this case the minority has a point.  We cannot pretend to have true separation of church and state if public school students are assumed to believe in a monotheistic god.  And who are we to claim that ours is a Nation "<a href="http://bensguide.gpo.gov/3-5/symbols/pledgeallegiance.html">under God</a>"?</p>

<h3 id="a000040">Breean sent me an article</h3>

<p>Breean sent me an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/opinion/25KRUG.html">article</a> from the NY Times called <i>The Reality Thing</i>.</p>
<blockquote><i>
For the distinctive feature of all the programs the administration
has pushed in response to real problems is that they do little or
nothing to address those problems.<br/><br/>
Problems are there to be used to pursue the vision. And a 
problem that won't serve that purpose, whether it's the 
collapse of confidence in corporate governance or the chaos 
in the Middle East, is treated as an annoyance to be 
ignored if possible, or at best addressed with purely 
cosmetic measures.
</i></blockquote>
<p>It's worth a read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/3444887.htm">PwC Consulting changes its name</a> to 'Monday'.  'Scuse me?</p>
<p>I hope nobody got paid in <i>actual US dollars</i> to come up with that.  Costa Rican colones, maybe, but not real money.  <i>Monday</i>?  Does it have any positive connotations?  Who likes Mondays?</p>
<p>Oh well.  They'll probably go bankrupt in a few years anyway.</p>

<p>Can you believe it?  I'm even late wishing myself a happy birthday.  Thanks for all great cards and gifts.</p>
<p>For the record, I decided that I would turn 24 again this year.</p>

<p>A company called Etherlinx wants to "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/technology/10WIRE.html">blanket entire urban regions</a>" with high-speed wireless Ethernet.</p>
<p>Is anyone concerned about the health dangers?  There's no way to 'opt out' of the blanket of electromagnetic radiation now covering our cities.  Do we really know if it poses a threat?  How could we?  We don't even know if cell phone usage is bad for the brain.</p>
<p>We need to ask if this is really worth the risk.  Personally, I don't want my child growing up in this environment.</p>

<h3 id="a000034">Pyramid Scheme Dot Com: How</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.beyondvalueinvesting.com/articles/pyramidscheme.htm">Pyramid Scheme Dot Com</a>:  <i>How I Realized The Internet Bubble Was A Pyramid Scheme</i></p>
<p>This guy worked for two years as an analyst at the Technology Group at CSFB.  Overall it's a great read.  He loses my respect at the end though, when he says that in future articles he'll tell you how "to time a bubble on the way up <i>and</i> the way down" [his emphasis].  Is it still a bubble if everyone knows it's a bubble?  Of course.</p>
