<p>I received two very exciting opportunities by email this morning.  Thought I'd be generous and share them with you.</p>
<p>First, there's a woman (I assume) looking for men from "West Europe/North America/Asian?" because "<a href="2002/09/19/men.txt">men in mine Country not so well</a>".</p>

<h3 id="a000098">UCSD RANKED SEVENTH NATIONALLY IN</h3>

<p><a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/jusnews03.htm">UCSD RANKED SEVENTH NATIONALLY IN U.S.NEWS 2003 SURVEY</a>.  Seventh of all U.S. four-year public schools.  31st overall.  Not too bad.  It sucks that Berkeley was the top public school.</p>
<p>For Berkeley and UCSD to rank so high they must overemphasize research and graduate education.  I never felt like UCSD really cared about undergraduates.  We were just a cash cow to support research.</p>

<h3 id="a000095">This is depressing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2002/09/13/longlives400.html?partner=yahoo&amp;referrer=">Why the Rich Live Longer</a></p>
<p>The answer, apparently, is that (surprise) <i>they have more money</i>.  Not that they have access to better health care, just that they are more successful than the rest of us.</p>
<p>And of course all measurements of success are relative:
<blockquote>
Put simply, it didn't so much matter how rich a person was; rather, what was important was how much better he was doing than his neighbors.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Don't believe it?  Ask the monkeys at the bottom of the social ladder.</p>

<h3 id="a000091">Ah, the chicken and the google again</h3>

<p>I'm reading about <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/1.html">how to submit</a> a site to <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a>.  You can <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl.html">add a url</a> to their index, but there's one problem:</p>
<blockquote>
The ONLY way a site is included in our index is if our crawlers are able to find it by jumping from link to link on the Web. If we have not found your pages, it is because we have not encountered any links on the web pointing to your site.
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose there aren't any links to your site from within Google's existing index?  Wouldn't the whole point of submitting a site be to <i>increase</i> the number of links to the site?  Why does <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl.html">this page</a> exist if not to add a site <i>without</i> any external links pointing to it?</p>

<h3 id="a000086">Oldmember</h3>

<p>Breean and I went movie hopping yesterday (don't tell).</p>
<p>First we saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286106">Signs</a>.  It was thrilling.  Mel was boring but the two kids were very good.  I think the highlight for me was the birthday party video from Brazil.</p>
<p>After waiting in line at the concession counter for a few minutes, we walked over to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0295178">Goldmember</a>.  <i>Boring</i>.  The eight year-old kids next to us liked it but I think they were the only ones.  It's time to kill the series.  It's dead.  The mojo is gone.  They can't repeat the same dumb jokes forever and expect anyone over eight to appreciate it.</p>
