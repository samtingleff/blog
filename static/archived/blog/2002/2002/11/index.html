<p>More from Wired News on <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,56510,00.html">indie filmaking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Several companies in New York are attempting to use digital moviemaking tools to produce a steady stream of low-budget, profitable and arty feature films. In at least two cases -- Independent Digital Entertainment (or InDigEnt) and Blow Up Pictures -- the plan seems to be working.
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blowuppictures.com/">Blow Up Pictures</a> claims not to be "dismantling the Hollywood studio system" but I hope they do.  Seems to me that to even use that phrase means the thought has crossed their minds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,56480,00.html">Spacey Site Screens Writers</a> [wired.com]</p>
<p>Kevin Spacey's <a href="http://www.triggerstreet.com">TriggerStreet.com</a> allows any aspiring filmmaker or screenwriter to upload a short screenplay and have it reviewed by peers for free.</p>
<blockquote>
"There's absolutely a possibility that we might find a relationship worth getting into," Spacey said in a brief interview. "I'm also hoping other production companies will be interested in looking at the material, too."
</blockquote>
<p>In yet another sign that he is actually from <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/k-pax.html">K-Pax</a>, Spacey says "there is no business plan."</p>

<h3 id="a000130">"Some of the mellow older residents look as if they arrived as flower children and never left"</h3>

<p>It feels good to be back home in California.  My fridge smells horrible though.  Somehow the power cable jigged loose early in the week and the fridge was off all week.  When I tried to poor out the milk nothing came out - it was completely solid.  I didn't even look at the yogurt.</p>
<p>The cooked pumpkin I had in the freezer is ruined, so any pumpkin pie I might make for Thanksgiving is going to be of the canned variety.</p>

<p>More on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/prayer.html">power of prayer</a> from Wired Magazine.</p>
<p><blockquote>
The research results showed that the subjects who were not prayed for spent 600 percent more days in the hospital. They contracted 300 percent as many AIDS-related illnesses.  That's a pretty sensationalistic way of saying those who were prayed for were a lot less sick.

Hi I would like to cite your work in a research paper I'm writing.<br/>

<h3 id="a000124">Want to know why voter</h3>

<p>Want to know why voter turnout is <a href="http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/local/elect02/11_4_02youth_voters.html">so low among young people</a>?  Easy.  Our choices for California Governor are Gray Davis and Bill Simon.  Our main exposure to the candidates is through negative ads that over-simplify the issues and obviously treat us all like idiots.</p>
<p>What's to get excited about?  Who's promising to get us jobs, to stop destruction of the environment or even - get this - <a href="http://cagreens.org/platform/democrac.htm">reform the electoral process</a>?  When the top issues are "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/06/elec02.main.wrap/index.html">war against terrorism, security at home, strong national defense and dealing honestly with the economy</a>" - in that order - why should we care?  And exactly how are Republicans "dealing honestly with the economy"?</p>

<p>The movie is great. Even Breean liked it. If you're worried that the movie is much worse than the TV show - <i>don't</i>.  Only a few sketches are significantly more gross than the show.</p>
