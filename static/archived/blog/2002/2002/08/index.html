<p>49% of Americans think that the First Amendment goes too far.  "Almost half also said the media has been too aggressive in asking the government questions about the war on terrorism."</p>
<p>It gets worse.

<p>I started planning my East coast trip last night.  I never realized just how <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/usa_pol01.jpg">small</a> all those New England states are!  California could <a href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/1998/antz/antz-n.htm">squash</a> them like little bugs.</p>
<p>It's exciting.  My first U.S. trip east of the Houston airport.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/29/technology/circuits/29PHON.html">When the Cellphone Is the Home Phone</a></p>
<p>The only surprise here is that <i>only</i> 3% of the country uses a cell as their primary phone.  Most of my friends - and I'll guess most college graduates after my generation - have both a cell and a land line.  But the cell phone is primary.</p>

<h3 id="a000077">What if we did this in the U.S.?</h3>

<p>I learned something cool in German class yesterday.  If I offend any Germans out there, I'm sorry.  This all comes from my teacher Katja.</p>
<p>Like most languages German has different personal pronouns for formal and informal interaction.  In Germany, though, you might know someone for 20 years and continue to speak wi
th the formal you ('Sie').</p>
<p>The only way that two adults might begin speaking to each other in the informal is after an explicit agreement.  There's even a traditional <i>ceremony</i> for this type of agreement.</p>
<p>It's called a <i>Bruderschaft trinken</i>.  Both people will hold a shot of Schnapps (or similar liquor), link arms and drink.  After this they will begin to speak with each other using the informal 'du'.</p>
<p>If there's anything we can conclude from this, this is it: the more rigid and formal a culture is, the more people are going to drink.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vegas.html">Hacking Las Vegas</a>: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE MIT BLACKJACK TEAM'S CONQUEST OF THE CASINOS</p>
<p>
 <blockquote>
Terminal C is buzzing and chaotic, an over-air-conditioned hive of college students escaping Boston for a long weekend. I am dressed like everyone else: baggy jeans, baseball hat, scuffed sneakers. But in my mind, I have as much chance of blending in as a radioactive circus clown.<br/><br/>There's enough money hidden under my clothes to buy a two-bedroom condo. And to top it off, there's $100,000 worth of yellow plastic casino chips jammed into the backpack slung over my right shoulder.
 </blockquote>
</p>
<p>I read this in the magazine a few weeks ago.  Great story!  Probably the most exciting thing you'll ever read that contains the phrase "straight-A engineering major at MIT."</p>

<!-- rspotd -->
<p>Time for another <a href="http://www.recessioncamp.com/">recession</a> stock pick of the day...</p>
<p>I read in the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/">Mercury</a> this morning that <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TGT&amp;d=t">Target</a> beat expectations.  38 cents per share ($344 million) in the second quarter, up from 30 cents last year.  Have you seen those Todd Oldham commercials?  He signed a <a href="http://www.naplesnews.com/02/06/neapolitan/d794879a.htm">deal</a> with Target to design home furnishings for "Gen Y'ers, who like things bright and bold".  The ads seem more directed at parents than anyone else, but maybe that's just me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/3877680.htm">Market enjoys second straight weekly gains</a></p>
<p>The chart watchers want us to believe July was the bottom.  But what's going to drive corporate profits up?</p>

<h3 id="a000070">At least he likes In-N-Out</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/08/schlosser/index.html">Salon review</a> of Fast Food Nation by <a href="http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/02/08/schlosser_interview/index.html">Eric Schlosser</a> is good enough to deserve another mention.</p>
<p>Did you know...
 <ul>
  <li>that every month more than 90% of American children eat at McDonald's.</li>
  <li>that the average American eats three hamburgers and four orders of french fries every week.</li>
  <li>that one out of every eight workers has at some point been employed by McDonald's. [I don't believe this]</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>The reviewer wishes that Schlosser "had tried to appeal more to the stomach than to the brain," by presenting alternatives to bad fast food.  Maybe he's right.  But what are those alternatives?  "Let them eat In N Out Double Doubles" can't be the only answer.</p>

<h3 id="a000069">Making me hungry</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/14/dining/14BURG.html">The Secret Behind a Burger Cult</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
In-N-Out, founded on the West Coast in 1948, is that rarest of chain restaurants: one with a cult following. Exalted both by hamburger fans and those who normally shun fast food, it has built its reputation on the rock of two beliefs: fast food should be made from scratch, and the whims of the customer should be entertained.
</blockquote>
<p>What's the secret?  The burgers and fries are better than anywhere else and the shakes are made from real ice cream.  Even the <a href="http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/08/schlosser/index.html">Fast Food Nation</a> guy likes it.</p>
<p>After experiencing In-N-Out in Southern California I won't go near Mickey D's or BK any more.</p>

<h3 id="a000065">Some revolution</h3>

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/05/technology/05MOOD.html">story</a> in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Times</a> today about a 'revolution' at AOL:
<blockquote>
 A study showed that when the number of pop-up ads was cut in half for a group of members, their satisfaction improved notably. That led not only to a cutback in the number of pop-ups across the service, but was, according to Mr. Leonsis, the catalyst for a revolution within AOL.
</blockquote>
What do you think happened when I tried to read the story?  Some <a href="2002/08/06/nypopup.jpg">annoying ad</a> popped up.</p>
<p>The Times has this amazing, unique position as <i>the</i> newspaper of record.  But just like AOL they risk losing their status online with ads that everybody hates.</p>
