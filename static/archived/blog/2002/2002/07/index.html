<h3 id="a000060">I wonder what Eminem thinks about this</h3>

<p>The FCC <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/technology/31TELE.html">thinks</a> [nytimes.com]that broadband is key for an economic recovery:</p>
<blockquote>
"Broadband very likely holds the key for the long-term recovery of the telecommunications industry and for our nation's long-term economic growth and its ability to compete on the global stage." [Michael Powell]
</blockquote>
<p>Not in it's current form.  Not as long as DSL is spelled ADSL and you only get 128kbps upstream.  Not until cable modem are dependable.  Not until ISPs stop forcing you to sign ridiculous usage agreements.</p>
<p>The ISPs and the telecoms and the FCC don't get it.  Consumers aren't passive.  We don't want the latest AOL Time Warner ABC Disney 'content' shoved down our throats through AOL keywords.</p>
<p>The business models are out there.  But they're not coming from Microsoft or ABC/Disney, so they don't even register with the telcos.</p>

<p>I had to use my company's online performance tool today.  The 'Business/Team Goals' page describes our overall business objective:</p>
<blockquote>
To be a pioneer and leader in the creation and delivery of valued solutions for strategic business processes that enable our customers' realization of their business goals and objectives.<br/><br/>
By our participation in the innovative business and technology community in America, we pursue the ongoing discovery of superior technologies and their application with an empowered team of people.

<p><i>Spies Like Us</i><br/>
Chris sent me <a href="2002/07/16/content.txt">this article</a> from the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/">Sydney Morning Herald</a>:
<blockquote>
The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States
citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil
liberties groups.
<br/><br/>
The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the
US will have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the
former East Germany through the infamous Stasi secret police. The
program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report
"suspicious activity".
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>What we really need is for the other 96% of American's to watch for suspicious activity <i>at the office</i>.</p>
