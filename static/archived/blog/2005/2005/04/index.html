<p>The Yuan doesn't go from 8.270 per dollar to 8.276 "by accident." This is a big event. I think it was a test of the government's ability to manage small currency shifts.</p>

<h3 id="a001175">Bush signs the "Family Entertainment and Copyright Act"</h3>

<p>From Chris, "This is crap and should be placed on your blog": <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/27/bush.movies.ap/index.html">Bush signs DVD filtering measure</a>:
<blockquote>
President Bush on Wednesday signed legislation aimed at helping parents keep their children from seeing sex scenes, violence and foul language in movie DVDs.<br/>
<br/>
The bill gives legal protections to the fledgling filtering technology that helps parents automatically skip or mute sections of commercial movie DVDs. Bush signed it privately and without comment, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said.

<h3 id="a001174">The disappearing wall b/w church and state</h3>

<p>From the NYT, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/opinion/26tue1.html?ex=1272168000&en=8eea22128bf5f58c&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">The Disappearing Wall</a>:
<blockquote>
Apart from confirming an unwholesome disrespect for traditional American values like checks and balances, the assault on judges is part of a wide-ranging and successful Republican campaign to breach the wall between church and state to advance a particular brand of religion. No theoretical exercise, the program is having a corrosive effect on policymaking and the lives of Americans.<br/>
...<br/>
Offices in the White House and federal departments pump public money to religious groups, but provide scant oversight or accountability to make sure that the money is spent on real services, not preaching. Indeed, Mr. Bush's goal is to finance programs that are explicitly religious.

A laptop computer was stolen from UC Berkeley on March 11, 2005. The stolen computer contained information on

<p>The NYT asks, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/arts/television/24carr.html?ex=1271995200&en=65fb75a037f75c67&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Will 'The Simpsons' Ever Age?</a>
<blockquote>
IF a person were to, for the sake of art or science, sit down and watch every episode of "The Simpsons" ever made, it would take him more than a week of no-sleep, back-to-back viewing in 350 half-hour increments.

In that marathon the viewer would learn that life on a street called Evergreen Terrace never really changes, that Bart, Lisa and Maggie, along with their creator, Matt Groening, will not grow up, and that the Simpsons, once viewed as the shock troops of cultural mortification, are a shining exemplar of family stability in the come and go world of television.

<h3 id="a001171">CS majors declining</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cra.org/CRN/articles/may05/vegso">Interest in CS as a Major Drops Among Incoming Freshmen</a>, from <i>Computing Research News</i> [via <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/04/23/1434224.shtml?tid=146&tid=218">/.</a>]:
<blockquote>
The percentage of incoming undergraduates indicating that they would major in CS declined by over 60 percent between the Fall of 2000 and 2004, and is now 70 percent lower than its peak in the early 1980s (Figure 1).<br/>
...<br/>
With a fall in degree production looming, it is difficult to see how CS can match expected future demand for IT workers without raising women's participation at the undergraduate level.
</blockquote>
Where do they come up with this stuff? China and India produce several millions more engineering graduates than the US every year, almost all willing to work for far less than any US graduate. There's no job security in the industry any more and from where I'm standing it's difficult to see any shortage of (global) supply of IT workers. Why would a rational college student head into an industry defined by globalization and price pressure?</p>

"...Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon of Surrey University decided to test whether there was any overlap between the personalities of business managers, psychiatric patients and hospitalised criminals (psychopathic and psychiatrically ill). Their results, published last month, make startling reading.<br/>

Board and Fritzon found that three of 11 personality disorders (PDs) were actually commoner in managers than in disturbed criminals."<br/>

<h3 id="a001164">Destination Johnson 2005</h3>

<p>This weekend was Destination Johnson, the annual weekend where we bring in admitted students and do our best to show them a good time. We hosted somebody last year and must have scared him away, because he decided not to come to Johnson.</p>
<p>It may have been a mistake to host somebody again this year, because it's rather difficult now not to be a cynical second-year. So I did my best to let our guy party with first-years both nights while I came home at the reasonable hour of 1 am. It was like having a teen-ager living with us.</p>
<p>I hope we did a better job this year. He seemed more enthusiastic about the school this morning but was still not ready to sign on the dotted line.</p>

<h3 id="a001163">Failing value of the dollar</h3>

<p>From my favorite financial column, the New Yorker Financial Page: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/050418ta_talk_surowiecki">In Yuan We Trust</a> [from <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">scripting news</a>]
<blockquote>
Of course, the Chinese and the Japanese could decide that the costs of the falling dollar are too great, and suddenly stop (or, at least, cut back sharply) their lending to the United States. This would lead to a so-called &#8220;hard landing&#8221; for the U.S. economy: high inflation, punitive interest rates, collapsing stock prices and housing prices.<br/>
It would also lead to bedlam for China and Japan. Their best customers would effectively be unable to afford their wares. To paraphrase John Paul Getty: If you owe the bank a hundred dollars, you&rsquo;ve got a problem. If you owe the bank three trillion dollars, the bank&rsquo;s got a problem.

<p><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001213.html">Business Schools are Struggling: Will Some Go Broke?</a>
<blockquote>
Applications to BusinessWeek's Top 30 MBA programs have dropped almost 30% overall since 1998, with some schools seeing declines of 50% or more. And with the job market improving, more prospective applicants may find themselves with opportunities that will, if history is any indicator, pull them away from B-school.
</blockquote>
That's a great leading indicator of an improving job market. We have a record number of admits at Destination Johnson this weekend, I wonder what our applications look like.</p>

Because of these distorted incentives, workers' largest short-term payoff comes from working in sweatshops, rather than investing in education, technical skills, or other things which ultimately boost capital stock, productivity and total welfare across China and the US. So everyone is worse off than they would be without Wal-Mart.
