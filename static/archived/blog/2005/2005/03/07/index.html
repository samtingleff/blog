<h3 id="a001139">Newsflash: sex doesn't sell</h3>

<p><a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/03/06/and_speaking_of.html">Sex doesn't sell</a>:
<blockquote>
in the wider population advertisers are finding that sex no longer sells the way it used to.<br/>
<br/>
Commercial and academic research supports the thesis. Only 6% of consumers surveyed by the CIM said they were positively influenced by sexual images in advertising. D_Code, a study of young consumers by HeadlightVision, another bit of WPP, concluded that they found sexually explicit advertising boring and repellent.

<p><a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2005/March/05/sport/stories/01sport.htm">For all Cards: Santa Cruz boys basketball wins its first section crown</a> (thanks Chris).
<blockquote>
The Santa Cruz High boys basketball team played a first half of defense Friday night as if the Cardinals had past players that failed to win a section title on the court with them helping out.<br/>
<br/>
The Cardinals made history with their first-ever Central Coast Section championship, beating Burlingame 56-42 in the Division III title game before an overflow crowd of over 2,100 at Foothill College.

Wish I could have been there.</p>

<h3 id="a001137">Benefits of diversity in social organizations</h3>

<p>From the NYT, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/sports/baseball/07psych.html?ex=1267851600&en=c6096326574284be&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Close Doesn't Always Count in Winning Games</a>: "Social scientists say that decentralized groups (like the Yankees) are more resilient than tighter-knit ones (like the Red Sox)."
<blockquote>
 But social scientists who have studied group performance under pressure say that often it is decentralized groups (like the Yankees) that prove more resilient than strongly connected ones (like the Red Sox); they are better able to weather outside criticism and internal quarrels.<br/>
<br/>
Evidence from personality profiles and from studies of military, corporate and space flight crews suggests that looser ties between group members can be a strength, if the team includes individuals who can generate collective emotion when needed. And the Yankees have several of them.<br/>
...<br/>
On a tightly knit team, by contrast, a falling out between key members can divide a squad, forcing people to take sides, psychologists say. "The idea is that any sort of problem is likely to ripple more strongly and quickly through a close group than one with weak ties," said Dr. Mark Granovetter, a professor of sociology at Stanford.
