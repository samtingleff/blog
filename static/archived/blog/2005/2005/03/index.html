<h3 id="a001150">More picking on GWB</h3>

<p>This is too funny. I have to share. From <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/25/what_would_gw_do.html">Joi Ito</a>.
<blockquote>
President Bush explaining his Social Security plan - Tampa, Florida - Feb. 4, 2005<br/>
<br/>
Woman in audience: I don't really understand. How is it the new [Social Security] plan is going to fix that problem?<br/>
<br/>
President Bush: Because the -- all which is on the table begins to address the big cost drivers. For example, how benefits are calculated, for example, is on the table. Whether or not benefits rise based upon wage increases or price increases. There's a series of parts of the formula that are being considered. And when you couple that, those different cost drivers, affecting those -- changing those with personal accounts, the idea is to get what has been promised more likely to be -- or closer delivered to what has been promised. Does that make any sense to you? It's kind of muddled. Look, there's a series of things that cause the -- like, for example, benefits are calculated based upon the increase of wages, as opposed to the increase of prices. Some have suggested that we calculate -- the benefits will rise based upon inflation, as opposed to wage increases. There is a reform that would help solve the red if that were put into effect. In other words, how fast benefits grow, how fast the promised benefits grow, if those -- if that growth is affected, it will help on the red.

<p>Way back when Carly <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/business/fiorina-world-bank-41010.html">was a candidate</a> for the job I said to myself, "Self, who could possibly be a worse candidate to run the World Bank?"</p>
<p>Thank you GWB, for proving me wrong <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050317/WOLFOWITZ17/TPInternational/Americas">with Wolfowitz</a>. I heard on NPR this morning that he <a href="http://www.ithacajournal.com/news/stories/20020427/localregional/222112.html">grew up in Ithaca</a>. <strike>That's a surprise.</strike> That might explain a few things about Wolfowitz.</p>

<h3 id="a001142">The sad state of journalism today</h3>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050314/pl_nm/media_report_dc_5">Study Shows U.S. Election Coverage Harder on Bush</a> (thanks Penni):
<blockquote>
U.S. media coverage of last year's election was three times more likely to be negative toward President Bush than Democratic challenger John Kerry, according to a study released Monday.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>But here's the interesting part:
<blockquote>
 Despite the growing importance of the Web, the report said investment was not keeping pace and some 62 percent of Internet professionals reported cutbacks in the newsroom in the last three years, even more than the 37 percent of print, radio and TV journalists who cited cutbacks in their newsrooms.<br/>
<br/>
"For all that the number of outlets has grown, the number of people engaged in collecting original information has not," the report said, noting that much of the investment was directed at repackaging and presenting information rather than gathering news. 
</blockquote>
Reminds me that I heard Laurie Garrett <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/14/151255">on Democracy Now</a> this morning discussing her resignation from Newsday. She resigned with a "scathing" memo to colleagues critisizing her employer for allegiance to market returns over journalism.
<blockquote>
&#8221;Honesty and tenacity (and for that matter, the working class) seem to have taken backseats to the sort of 'snappy news', sensationalism, scandal-for-the-sake of scandal crap that sells. This is not a uniquely Tribune or even newspaper industry problem: this is true from the Atlanta mixing rooms of CNN to Sulzberger's offices in Times Square. Profits: that's what it's all about now. But you just can't realize annual profit returns of more than 30 percent by methodically laying out the truth in a dignified, accessible manner. And it's damned tough to find that truth every day with a mere skeleton crew of reporters and editors."

<h2>March 09, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a001141">Short on Clear Channel Communications (CCU)</h3>

<p>My second tingleff.com exclusive stock pick is a short. Clear Channel Communications (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CCU&d=t">NYSE:CCU</a>) "is a diversified media company with three primary business segments: radio broadcasting, outdoor advertising and live entertainment." 41% of total revenue comes from radio broadcasting, 24% from outdoor advertising and 30% from live entertainment.</p>
<p>This choice was partly motivated by a Business Week <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/@@6Sd5C2YQMBgxsQ4A/premium/content/05_11/b3924040_mz011.htm">article on the company</a> (sub req'd). You know you're in trouble when even Business Week sees the threats.</p>
<p>This is why I'm a long-term short on Clear Channel:
 <ul>
  <li>Consolidation in the radio industry has naturally led to <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/telecom/analysis/CompanyProfile.aspx?HOID=183">increased homogeneity and decreased creativity</a>. This is a classic recipe for unhappy customers.</li>
  <li>Competitive threat from three disruptive technologies: internet radio, satellite radio and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasting</a> (peer-to-peer). At least one of the two satellite radio companies will survive, internet radio has already made it and podcasting is rapidly growing.</li>
  <li>Decreasing tolerance by advertisers for mass-market broadcast media. Advertisers now have millions of choices and most would prefer mediums that are highly targeted and measurable. Radio (and outdoor advertising) of the type produced by Clear Channel is neither.</li>
  <li>Personally, the only radio I listen to is NPR. Everything else is filled with ads and is 80% bad music.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>At a ttm P/E of 24.54 (compare with <a href="http://www.vtoreport.com/pe_ratio.htm">20.5 for the S&P 500</a>), I don't think this risk is adequately priced into the stock.</p>
<p>Update: The Big Picture <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/03/adjusting_the_d.html">agrees that radio sucks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a001140">Harvard Business School rejects "hackers"</h3>

<p>There was news recently that Harvard had rejected b-school applicants said to have <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/03/08/harvard_rejects_applicants_it_says_hacked/">"hacked" into the application system</a>. Turns out that all they had done is <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2005/03/08#a7726">play around with URLs</a> to find out their admission status several weeks early.</p>
<p>That is, by editing a URL like <a href="http://sam.tingleff.com/photos/berlin060803/">http://sam.tingleff.com/photos/berlin060803/</a> to <a href="http://sam.tingleff.com/cms/photos/">http://sam.tingleff.com/cms/photos/</a> you could discover if you had been accepted into HBS a few weeks early.</p>
<p>This is hardly an offense you could call "hacking" and definitely not an ethical lapse justifying rejection. I feel for the applicants denied just because of this. If I had the option I probably would have done the same thing and not given it a second-thought.</p>

<blockquote>
in the wider population advertisers are finding that sex no longer sells the way it used to.<br/>
<br/>
Commercial and academic research supports the thesis. Only 6% of consumers surveyed by the CIM said they were positively influenced by sexual images in advertising. D_Code, a study of young consumers by HeadlightVision, another bit of WPP, concluded that they found sexually explicit advertising boring and repellent.

<h3 id="a001137">Benefits of diversity in social organizations</h3>

<p>From the NYT, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/sports/baseball/07psych.html?ex=1267851600&en=c6096326574284be&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Close Doesn't Always Count in Winning Games</a>: "Social scientists say that decentralized groups (like the Yankees) are more resilient than tighter-knit ones (like the Red Sox)."
<blockquote>
 But social scientists who have studied group performance under pressure say that often it is decentralized groups (like the Yankees) that prove more resilient than strongly connected ones (like the Red Sox); they are better able to weather outside criticism and internal quarrels.<br/>
<br/>
Evidence from personality profiles and from studies of military, corporate and space flight crews suggests that looser ties between group members can be a strength, if the team includes individuals who can generate collective emotion when needed. And the Yankees have several of them.<br/>
...<br/>
On a tightly knit team, by contrast, a falling out between key members can divide a squad, forcing people to take sides, psychologists say. "The idea is that any sort of problem is likely to ripple more strongly and quickly through a close group than one with weak ties," said Dr. Mark Granovetter, a professor of sociology at Stanford.

<h3 id="a001136">Greenspan vs. Bush</h3>

<p>NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/business/02cnd-deficit.html?ex=1267506000&en=e98aa6f163e5966c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Greenspan Warns Congress That Deficits Are 'Unsustainable'</a>
<blockquote>
"When you begin to do the arithmetic of what the rising debt level implied by the deficits tells you, and you add interest costs to that ever-rising debt, at ever-higher interest rates, the system becomes fiscally destabilizing," Mr. Greenspan said.
</blockquote>
This is an interesting battle - the predominantly Republican free-market-based business world vs. Bush's faith-based ideology. My money is on Greenspan because that's where the GOP gets it's funding, i.e., big money listens to Greenspan far more than to Bush.</p>

<h3 id="a001134">More on the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/business/02tele.html?ex=1267419600&en=f12767a9017ca20f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Man of Many Names Now Called No. 1 Tax Cheat</a>:
<blockquote>
Walter Anderson, the telephone entrepreneur accused of being the biggest tax cheat in American history, started playing with his name when he was 12 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Acquiring aliases became a habit that the government now says is central to how he evaded taxes on at least $450 million in income.<br/>
<br/>
His first alias, his mother told the government, involved unofficially shortening his given name, Walter Anderson Crump. The government says he has used at least seven other aliases to hide his income.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>I know I've used at least three variations of my name already. Just four more and I'll be on par with this guy! I hope my mom wouldn't sell me out so easily though.</p>

<h3 id="a001133">So much for separation of church and state</h3>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=544&e=3&u=/ap/bush_faith_based">Bush Pushes Faith-Based Initiative</a>
<blockquote>
 Bush, who often talks about how his Methodist faith helped him stop drinking, referred to his own experience when he sought to dismiss critics who contend his plan could promote discrimination.<br/>
<br/>
"If you're the Methodist church and you sponsor an alcohol treatment center, they can't say only Methodists, only Methodists who drink too much can come to our program," Bush said. "All drunks are welcome, is what the sign ought to say."<br/>
 Bush says the charities are effective because of the shared values and religious identity of their volunteers and employees. Critics take issue with his insistence that taxpayer-funded groups have the right to hire and fire based on religion.
