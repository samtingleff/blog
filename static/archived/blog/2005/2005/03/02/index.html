<h3 id="a001136">Greenspan vs. Bush</h3>

<p>NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/business/02cnd-deficit.html?ex=1267506000&en=e98aa6f163e5966c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Greenspan Warns Congress That Deficits Are 'Unsustainable'</a>
<blockquote>
"When you begin to do the arithmetic of what the rising debt level implied by the deficits tells you, and you add interest costs to that ever-rising debt, at ever-higher interest rates, the system becomes fiscally destabilizing," Mr. Greenspan said.
</blockquote>
This is an interesting battle - the predominantly Republican free-market-based business world vs. Bush's faith-based ideology. My money is on Greenspan because that's where the GOP gets it's funding, i.e., big money listens to Greenspan far more than to Bush.</p>

<h3 id="a001134">More on the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/business/02tele.html?ex=1267419600&en=f12767a9017ca20f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Man of Many Names Now Called No. 1 Tax Cheat</a>:
<blockquote>
Walter Anderson, the telephone entrepreneur accused of being the biggest tax cheat in American history, started playing with his name when he was 12 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Acquiring aliases became a habit that the government now says is central to how he evaded taxes on at least $450 million in income.<br/>
<br/>
His first alias, his mother told the government, involved unofficially shortening his given name, Walter Anderson Crump. The government says he has used at least seven other aliases to hide his income.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>I know I've used at least three variations of my name already. Just four more and I'll be on par with this guy! I hope my mom wouldn't sell me out so easily though.</p>

<h3 id="a001133">So much for separation of church and state</h3>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=544&e=3&u=/ap/bush_faith_based">Bush Pushes Faith-Based Initiative</a>
<blockquote>
 Bush, who often talks about how his Methodist faith helped him stop drinking, referred to his own experience when he sought to dismiss critics who contend his plan could promote discrimination.<br/>
<br/>
"If you're the Methodist church and you sponsor an alcohol treatment center, they can't say only Methodists, only Methodists who drink too much can come to our program," Bush said. "All drunks are welcome, is what the sign ought to say."<br/>
 Bush says the charities are effective because of the shared values and religious identity of their volunteers and employees. Critics take issue with his insistence that taxpayer-funded groups have the right to hire and fire based on religion.
