<h3 id="a001208">"Is Wharton Evil?"</h3>

<p>Ha, this is too hard to resist <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/InfectiousGreed?m=1089">picking on Wharton</a>:
<blockquote>
For decades, Whartonites had gathered on Thursday afternoons (there are no Friday classes) for a prolonged on-campus happy hour "Pub" attended and staffed by MBAs; in February, however, an MBA imbibed so much that he passed out and had to be hospitalized. The ensuing investigation by the school's risk management department yielded some sobering findings &#8212; namely, that Pub managers were paying themselves $31.25 an hour. "In the era of Dick Grasso, the one lesson we should all learn is that executives should not set their own compensation," Dean Jain drily opined in the Wharton Journal.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>We had the some type of thing (the Thursday happy hour staffed by MBAs, not the students passing out) and I can assure you that all I ever made is $60 - in tips - for a volleyball club trip and two free light beers.</p>

<h3 id="a001206">Flying to California on Sunday</h3>

<p>We have sold our couch, television, dining table, coffee table, microwave and bed. All I have left to go is my snowboard (<i>my precious</i>). For the next four days we will be living a spartan, zen-like existance. Though I think the heat is making both of us delirious, so we will have trouble amusing ourselves.</p>
<p>Moving by UPS is something I hope never to repeat.</p>

<h3 id="a001205">Supernanny</h3>

<p>Things we have learned from watching Supernanny...
<ol>
 <li>Do not punish children by sending them to the bedroom. If they have a fun room with lots of toys this is hardly a punishment. In any case, you're sending a confusing message: is the bedroom a place to sleep or a site of punishment? Use a "naughty corner" or a "naughty room" like a guest bedroom. When you let them out, squat to their level and make them apologize.</li>
 <li>Sit down to their level and give eye contact when disciplining. Make sure they understand why they're being disciplined.</li>
 <li>Do not allow naps longer than 1.5 hours - they'll never fall asleep at night.</li>
 <li>When they sulk - probably when finally leaving the naughty corner - ignore it and be very positive.</li>
 <li>Keep a very strict schedule. Kids should eat, play, nap, etc. at the same times every day.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a001202">Five (six) things I learned in business school</h3>

<p>From Fred Wilson: <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/06/the_five_things.html">The Five Things I Learned In Business School</a>. I tried this exercise with my parents a few months ago. His is more finance-heavy, maybe it's a Wharton vs. Cornell thing. Note the first is the same for both of us. Here's my updated list:
<ol>
 <li>Finance: the time value of money. Everybody knows a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow but before b-school I never really <strike>understand</strike> understood (clearly spelling/grammar is not one of them) the underpinings and the scale of the concept.</li>
 <li>Management: incentives are everything, or... people generally do exactly that for which they will be rewarded.</li>
 <li>Strategy: industry structures are not formed by God, but rather by real people making active decisions. Why does <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=DELL&annual">Dell</a> make $3b per year while many of their suppliers struggle to survive? It's not just luck.</li>
 <li>Accounting: "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/">postcard from Bolivia</a>" - my professor says not to write off a receivable till you receive a "postcard from Bolivia." He still receives real postcards from students visiting Bolivia.</li>
 <li>Econ: opportunity costs matter - always acknowledge and quantify them.</li>
 <li>Marketing: marketing is not just advertising. When you buy an Apple product, it comes in beautiful packaging and is a pleasure to open. Marketing encompasses product definition and every customer interaction.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="a001201">Fair-Mart: the fair trade alternative retailer</h3>

<p>A free idea for someone with more money than I right now...</p>
<p>A big-box retailer, like Wal-Mart/Kmart/Target/etc. except that all products are sourced solely through "fair trade" practices, however you might define that. I understand that niche retailers like <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/">Global Exchange</a> have a similar goal but they primarily focus on gifts, not the necessities many of us shop for at Target or Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>If there was a place to buy such necessities without the guilt of suporting child labor, polluting third-world countries and supporting human rights violations, I belive many in core blue-state cities would welcome the opportunity.</p>
<p>Prices would be higher, but that's a feature not a bug. Paying high prices is how customers would know that they're doing the right thing. It would help them to feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>I think the time is right for a retailer like this. Kmart/Sears is a historical relic and Wal-Mart is coming under increasing fire in the mainstream press. Maybe my perspective is tainted from living in Ithaca and the SF area, but I don't think the target demo even shops at Wal-Mart right now. The only real competition is Target.</p>
<p>Build a cool brand like <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/">Anthropologie</a> or <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/">Restoration Hardware</a>. Think of it as the Whole Foods of retail (thanks Baldzilla).</p>

<h3 id="a001199">Monkeys with money</h3>

<p>From the NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html?ex=1275624000&en=af2d9755a2c32ba8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Monkey Business</a>. Training capuchin monkeys to use money [from <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/06/money_2005_hedg.html">the big picture</a>]:
<blockquote>
It took several months of rudimentary repetition to teach the monkeys that these tokens were valuable as a means of exchange for a treat and would be similarly valuable the next day. Having gained that understanding, a capuchin would then be presented with 12 tokens on a tray and have to decide how many to surrender for, say, Jell-O cubes versus grapes. This first step allowed each capuchin to reveal its preferences and to grasp the concept of budgeting.

<h3 id="a001197">We're back from St. Lucia</h3>

<p>The night before our 5:30 am flight out from Ithaca this little critter was flying laps around our bedroom. We managed to finagle him into our sun (snow) deck and let the landlord deal with it while we lied on the beach.</p>

<h3 id="a001195">More on Deep Throat</h3>

<p>The story of how Deep Throat and Bob Woodward <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html">communicated</a> is pretty interesting. From <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/deep_throat_tra.html">schneier</a>:
<blockquote>
We would need a preplanned notification system -- a change in the environment that no one else would notice or attach any meaning to. I didn't know what he was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep the drapes in your apartment closed, open them and that could signal me, he said. I could check each day or have them checked, and if they were open we could meet that night at a designated place. I liked to let the light in at times, I explained.<br/>
<br/>
We needed another signal, he said, indicating that he could check my apartment regularly. He never explained how he could do this.
