<h3 id="a000828">Gainful employment</h3>

<p>I've accepted a summer internship at <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>, a small internet videoconferencing company that <a href="http://brv.cornell.edu/">BR Ventures</a> has invested in. It's a great company and I'm excited about working there.</p>
<p>This means I'll be in Berkeley, CA from May 31st till August 6th (and need housing!). I'm looking forward to the California summer.</p>
<p>Breean points out that the summer here (Ithaca) will be ten times better. It will - cause she'll be here.</p>
<p>Some free advice for those posting on community housing sites like <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a>:
<ul>
 <li>As a general rule, more info is better than less</li>
 <li>For sublets, indicate <i>the dates the room is available</i></li>
 <li>Internet access is important - <i>if it's available, say so</i></li>
 <li>For shared housing, tell me <i>who else will be living there</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="a000824">Global Social Venture Competition</h3>

<p>A Johnson team won the SROI category in the <a href="http://www.socialvc.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageId=135&grandparentID=10&parentID=80">2004 Global Social Venture Competition</a>. Congratulations! Here's the concept:
<blockquote>
Distributed Generation Technologies (DGT) is focused on commercializing innovative energy technologies for distributed generation. The company is commercializing a new anaerobic digestion reactor, developed at Cornell University, which converts organic waste into highly pure and compressed biogas (i.e., methane fuel) without additional equipment or energy input.<br/>
<br/>
The resulting biogas can be utilized as a transportation fuel (compressed natural gas) and/or paired with a fuel cell or other device for stationary generation. The company expects to commercialize larger-scale equipment in the wastewater, agriculture, and food processing markets initially, while working toward mass market &#8220;appliances&#8221; for residential applications in developed and developing economies.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Mom, dad, you might want to look at <a href="http://www.socialvc.net/_uploads/documents/live/DGT_GSVC_deck_FINAL_v2.ppt">their ppt</a>. Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>The admissions argument over the last few years has been framed around race but as this article indicates family economics are probably far more meaningful.</p>

<h3 id="a000822">Unpaid internships</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/usatonline/20040420/6127403s.htm">With interns, you get what you pay for</a> [from <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">Mefi</a>]:
<blockquote>
For-profit businesses can't pay less than minimum wage, but labor laws allow exceptions -- if the job is for the educational benefit of the student, and -- the kicker, according to Birmingham, Ala.-based labor lawyer John Richard Carrigan -- if the employer derives no immediate benefit from the intern's work.
</blockquote>
I sent letters to several California politicians about this a few years ago after a particularly boring summer as an "intern" at a PR firm. It was paid, but only a token amount and far below minimum wage. I knew I was worth more than that and felt used and abused.</p>
<p>But the politicians didn't get it. Feinstein's flaks sent me a form letter about (unpaid) internship opportunities in her office. As did the rest of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=568&e=1&u=/nm/leisure_mcdonalds_dc">McDonald's CEO Dead, COO Takes Helm</a>: "McDonald's Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Cantalupo died of an apparent heart attack on Monday in Florida and the company named Chief Operating Officer Charlie Bell to replace him as CEO."</p>
<p>Is this type of risk reflected in the stock price? You have to assume that: 1) company officers are largely older men; and 2) their diets are perhaps not ideal from a nutritional standpoint . So there may be a succession issue at Mickey D's - executives in their prime happen to be prime candidates for heart attacks. I wonder if this is taken into account by long range planners at the company.</p>

<h3 id="a000809">Destination Johnson...</h3>

<p>Was this weekend. Every year Johnson invites all the MBA admits to Ithaca for one weekend. They stay with a current student, go to panel discussions and (endless) info sessions and we try to pretend that students here have a good time. Breean was <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2004/04/18/index.html#000806">a real trooper</a> about it.</p>
<p>We hosted someone from California who's been travelling in Turkey and Nepal recently and will be in India this summer. Naturally both of us liked him. When he first arrived he said he was undecided on coming to Johnson - not the school so much as b-school in general. By Saturday afternoon his tune had changed, for the worse. He said he's even more committed to the school but would rather wait another one or two years.</p>
<p>He assured us that this was not my fault at all but I can't help feel responsible.</p>

<blockquote>
No campfires. No hiking. Just hours a day of essay writing, SAT preparation, counseling, mock admission interviews and a potpourri of workshops and college visits, all intended to give high school students an edge on the admission process.
</blockquote>
What a waste of time. This arms race of admissions is reaching ridiculous proportions and something needs to be done.</p>

<h3 id="a000804">The Apprentice ends</h3>

<p>My girl Amy lost and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-TV-Apprentice-Finale.html?ex=1397448000&en=d351b686606a05b1&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">Bill won</a>. Oh well, at least the HBS guy lost.</p>
<p>Wasn't the winner supposed to land a job as president of one of Trump's companies? The NYT says Bill will oversee "a 90-story building project in Chicago." I don't know about you but that's definitely not my "dream job of a lifetime." And it doesn't sound like president of anything.</p>
<p>We won't be watching next season. Too many contestants were so obviously also-rans that it took too long to get down to the tough decisions. I hope next time they choose contestants based on ability to deliver rather than look good in a skirt or cause controversy.</p>
<p>The show did bring home a point for me though. You never really know how someone will behave on the job without obverving them in real-world situations. People with the best resumes, references and interview skills could turn out to be another Omarosa. The traditional interview-hiring process is broken and I wonder if there's an opportunity to provide a better model.</p>

<h3 id="a000803">Abby Cohen</h3>

<p>I saw <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/pundits/index.cfm?story=cohen">Abby Cohen</a> speak today as part of Johnson's ongoing <a href=" www.johnson.cornell.edu/anniversary/index.html">20th anniversary celebration</a>. She's Chair of the Investment Policy Committee for Goldman Sachs and today she made a pretty convincing argument that the economic rebound is well on its way but remains hampered by governmental policy throughout the world.</p>
<p>My complaint with so many speakers of her stature is that they can speak for hours <i>without saying anything meaningful</i>. Politicians and CEOs are great at this. But I was extremely impressed both with what she had to see and how she said it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2004/nf20040415_1545_db017.htm">Analyzing the "Sins" of Wal-Mart</a>:
<blockquote>
But like it or not, the opinions of this far-flung group are helping to shape a broad and growing anti-Wal-Mart movement that goes well beyond organized labor. And considering that the retail behemoth is in less than 40% of the top 100 grocery markets, Wal-Mart will increasingly face this crowd as it tries to move into untapped urban areas with its supercenters.<br/>
<br/>
The daylong litany of Wal-Mart's alleged failings should provide plenty of fodder for its opponents. Take employee relations, once considered a Wal-Mart strength. Ellen Rosen, a professor at the Center for the Study of Women at Brandeis University, is using Wal-Mart as a case study in a book on gender stratification in the retail trade. She has been collecting the tales of dozens of current and former Wal-Mart workers, from cashiers to store managers.

<h3 id="a000788">Rankings</h3>

<p>Johnson moved up two spots in this year's US News &amp; World Report <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/mba/brief/mbarank_brief.php">annual ranking of b-schools</a>. We're up to 14, from 16 the past three years. Good news!</p>
<p>There's lots of talk about gaining a consistent top-10 ranking, but it's going to be difficult for us. Some study (don't remember) showed that size of the school and number of alumni correlates pretty strongly with ranking. Tuck and Haas are obvious exceptions at 8 and 9 with sizes similar to Johnson, but others ahead of us are larger and better-located.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rich get richer: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2004/nf2004046_1453.htm">Harvard and Wharton won't provide</a> access to students for the Business Week 2004 report.</p>

<p><a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2004/04/spectacular_job.html">Spectacular Job numbers not an April's Fool Joke</a>: "U.S. employers in March hired workers at the fastest clip in four years, offering the brightest sign yet for the struggling labor market. Nonfarm business payrolls grew by 308,000 jobs last month, faster than at any time since April of 2000."</p>

<h3 id="a000776">The Apprentice</h3>

<p><a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2004/01/10/index.html#000584">Breean's pick</a> <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/contestants/about_troy.shtml">Troy</a> was fired. As Trump said, it came down to a guy with a high school diploma who's shown real leadership and a Harvard MBA who's been elected team leader three times and never shown much of anything (no surprise there!). I was surprised when Trump chose to keep the Harvard guy.</p>
<p><i>Two</i> people get fired next week. And our favorite <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/contestants/about_omarosa.shtml">Omarosa</a> will come back.</p>

<h3 id="a000775">Google mail</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2004/tc2004041_5024_tc120.htm">Google Drops an E-Mail Bomb</a>. Free web-based email with 1GB of storage (that's a lot) and google search capabilities on your inbox. Nobody seems to know if it's a joke or not but BWeek doesn't think so because of Google's plans to go public.</p>
<blockquote>
Google will add unobtrusive text ads targeting the content of e-mail. For example, if a Gmail user receives a message about the NCAA basketball finals, then Google will put a hoops- or sports-related ad into the e-mail. Those ads, wagers Google President Larry Page, will more than pay for the cost of giving users so much space. 
</blockquote>

<p>I've used a searchable mail program for a while now and I can attest that it is tremendously useful.</p>
