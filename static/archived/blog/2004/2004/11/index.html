<h3 id="a001064">Happy Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving everybody!</p>
<p>We're taking it easy this year - precooked turkey and gravy mix. Real mashed potatoes, naturally. Last year we spent a lot of time cooking a big meal. It was delicious, of course, but not worth the time for just the two of us. So this year I'm thankful that we don't have to cook.</p>

<h3 id="a001063">Succession planning at Mickey D's</h3>

<p>Remember way back on <a href="2004/04/19/index.html">April 19, 2004</a> when the CEO of McDonald's <a href="2004/04/19/810/index.html">died of a heart attack</a>? We wondered if ailments due to poor nutrition is something their succession plan takes into account.</p>
<p>COO Charlie Bell took over as CEO at the time. Here we are, just seven months later and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/business/23mcdonalds.html">Citing Cancer, Chief Resigns at McDonald's</a>. Apparently the the diagnosis came just one month after being named CEO.</p>
<p>Let's see if the "more health-conscious and light alternatives" now on the menu help the new CEO, James Skinner, last any longer. This doesn't bode well for Mr. Skinner:
<blockquote>
Both Mr. Skinner and Mr. Roberts, like Mr. Bell, are lifelong McDonald's employees. Where Mr. Bell started his McDonald's career flipping burgers and mopping floors at the age of 15, Mr. Skinner, 60, joined in 1971 as a restaurant manager trainee in Carpentersville, Ill.

<h3 id="a001062">Mileage Plus sucks</h3>

<p>Why did I bother accumulating all those United miles if they never let me redeem them? Between the blackout dates and the limited seats they make available it's essentially impossible to plan award travel on United.</p>
<p>Forget it, they lost me as a loyal customer. Those stupid reward programs are the only thing keeping the "legacy" airlines alive. If they can't even manage those to customer satisfaction they have no chance in hell of surviving. United has lost my business.</p>

<h3 id="a001060">Civilization, again</h3>

<p>This weekend I flew to the DC area for an interview with a small tech company involved in digital media. Friday they put us through <i>five interviews</i> and a half-hour <i>test</i>, which they called a "survey." Saturday we played laser tag - I came in second - had lunch and saw the usual DC suspects (photos soon).</p>

<p>Turns out that the FCC's record $1.2 million fine against Fox for the "suggestion of sex" on <i>Married by America</i> was prompted by an <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_11_15.html#008481">entire 23 people and only three unique complaints</a> [from <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/11/regulation.html">Jeff Nolan</a>].</p>
<p>This is ridiculous. I'm going to complain about all the crap on tv, maybe then they'll fine ABC for <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/11/regulation.html">According to Jim</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a001040">The Day the Enlightenment Went Out</h3>

<p>From the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/opinion/04wills.html">The Day the Enlightenment Went Out</a>:
<blockquote>
This election confirms the brilliance of Karl Rove as a political strategist. He calculated that the religious conservatives, if they could be turned out, would be the deciding factor. The success of the plan was registered not only in the presidential results but also in all 11 of the state votes to ban same-sex marriage. Mr. Rove understands what surveys have shown, that many more Americans believe in the Virgin Birth than in Darwin's theory of evolution.<br/>
<br/>
This might be called Bryan's revenge for the Scopes trial of 1925, in which William Jennings Bryan's fundamentalist assault on the concept of evolution was discredited. Disillusionment with that decision led many evangelicals to withdraw from direct engagement in politics. But they came roaring back into the arena out of anger at other court decisions - on prayer in school, abortion, protection of the flag and, now, gay marriage. Mr. Rove felt that the appeal to this large bloc was worth getting President Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage (though he had opposed it earlier).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a001030">I voted</h3>

<p>After seeing my polling place today I am glad to know that we have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/08/international.observers/">OSCE observers monitoring the process</a>.</p>
<p>My "ward", which I assume is just some fraction of the city of Ithaca, is divided into two districts. My polling place had one line for each district, with a map and a person to help people figure out which district they are in. Of course <i>everybody</i> is in my district, leaving one of the two voting machines and 50% of the workers idle while the other line nears 30 people.</p>
<p>As this line backed up, the two older women with the voter registration books showed no sign of hurry. Not only were they not hurrying, they were some of the <i>slowest</i> moving people I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Imagine the scene like this:<br/>
------- line of people ------------- [voter sign-in] - [voting booth]<br/>
The [voting booth] only holds one person at a time and clearly is the bottleneck. With 20+ people waiting in front of the [voter sign-in], you might think they would add a buffer of even one person between the [voter sign-in] and the [voting booth] to ensure that the [voting booth] (which is the bottleneck, remember?) operates at 100% capacity. No. The [voting booth] appears to be idle about 30% of the time because the two older women at the [voter sign-in] are so slow and do not recognize the need for a buffer.</p>
<p>We were joking around in line about how they might actually slow the process even further. When... some guy in an NRA hat starts complaining that the voting machine is broken. Fortunately he was referring to the other machine but we had to laugh.</p>
<p>Oh yeah - it sucks to know that my vote doesn't count for anything. That's so stooopid.</p>
