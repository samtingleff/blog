<p>Chris wanted me to post this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_basketball/20040331-9999-news_1s31ucsdhoop.html">UCSD men's hoops: Mission impossible?</a> Coach Greg Lanthier was fired recently and six players quit the team (in protest? unclear). It sounds like the administration expects to build a quality program without putting up the cash for scholarships.</p>

<h3 id="a000772">My Rob Ryan experience</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.entrepreneur-america.com/team_member.asp?uid=1">Rob Ryan</a> was the founder of <a href="http://www.lucent.com/press/0699/990624.coa.html">Ascend Communications</a>, a company he eventually sold for $24b to Lucent. I think he owned about 8% of the company at the time. He's at the school this week and next teaching a short class on the 'sunflower model', his technique for adding a new product every year at growing companies. I'm in the class.</p>
<p>This afternoon I was walking to his class and found him wondering around downstairs after guest lecturing for the undergraduate entrepreneurship class. I asked "are you looking for your next class?" He sort of nodded, so I started talking to him and led him to the classroom. He seems like a normal guy, like the rest of us except for well... he has a lot more money.</p>
<p>As they say, the best time to raise money is when you're not looking for it.</p>

<h3 id="a000763">Censorship in China</h3>

<p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/27/wearing_black_in_protest.html"> Wearing black in protest</a>. China bans all <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a> sites - a significant and growing source of independent news and thought - from the country.</p>
<p>This brings up one issue about outsourcing that has mostly been neglected. Never mind the lost jobs and economic transition - imagine if the U.S. or the WTO were to require respect for basic human rights from any country wishing to trade with us. And I consider open access to information a basic human right.</p>

<h3 id="a000761">SV day four</h3>

<p>Today 10 of us visited Sequoia Capital, Benchmark and <a href="http://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>. None of them have jobs, of course, so it was primarily informational. <i>Much</i> more interesting than the large tech companies of the first three days this week.
<p>We met with partners at all of these firms and each gave us a very honest assessment of the vc industry, their firm and our chances of finding a job in the industry (zero). With only ten students it was extremely informal - all but Sequoia left the powerpoint for another day. It was interesting to see some of the philosophical differences between three successful vcs.</p>

<h3 id="a000760">Silicon Valley madness</h3>

<p>I ditched the school trip this afternoon and missed visits to Intel and HP. I've had enough and needed some time to decompress. Call it my four hour spring break.</p>
<p>These large companies were all starting to look the same: "We work hard but play hard too!" "We have a very entrepreneurial culture!"</p>
<p>I'm still feeling like the only b-school student in the country <i>not</i> interested in working 60+ hours per week after graduating. I just don't get it... is the <a href="http://www.hjventures.com/glossary-return-on-investment-ROI.html">ROI</a> on your time really there?</p>

The Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley recently started the Center for Responsible Business, which includes seven new ethics courses. The program will require first-year students to visit executives in jail.

<p>Wow, I wish we had the opportunity to visit execs in jail. How fun would that be?</p>

There could be no more telling juxtaposition of events than to have a petulant NBA millionaire throw a fit of ego on the very day that hundreds of college players, from mighty Kentucky to little Liberty, are preparing to throw their heart and soul into a series of games for which they will not be paid a cent. (All right, maybe a few of them are getting a buck or two under the table, but let's drop the cynicism for a moment, shall we?)

<h3 id="a000730">Netflix</h3>

<p>We signed up with <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> yesterday. It turns out that we've been spending about $30 per month at Blockbuster Video since last December so the $20 per month at Netflix should actually save money.</p>
<p>The selection is great and they claim two-day shipping even out here in the boonies. We'll see how it works out.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Netflix, the deal is that you can have <i>three</i> dvds checked out at any time. When you finish one, mail it back (postage paid) and when they receive it they'll ship out another movie from your queue right away. For $20 per month. It's great for people watching a lot of movies or stuck with late fees all the time. Competition is heating up in the space and I'm curious to see if they'll survive.</p>

<h3 id="a000723">Unintended consequences</h3>

<p>Interesting piece in the journal on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107843948785646943,00.html?mod=home%5Fpage%5Fone%5Fus">the changing face of stock research</a> [sub req'd]. One consequence of the separation of investment banking and research is that research now has to pay the bills. Can the average joe pay for it? I think not:
<blockquote>
At the big Wall Street firms, the focus increasingly is on white-glove service for investment institutions. At Credit Suisse First Boston last week, analyst Ivy Zelman played host to 20 trading clients at a private event at the Detroit-area offices of Masco Corp., a maker of building products. Portfolio managers from clients such as Alliance Capital Management Holding LP and TIAA-CREF got to question executives of Masco and one of its customers over dinner. The next day, they drilled down into operations with division chiefs.
</blockquote>

<p>The WSJ thinks we're still better off than when i-bankers owned the analysts, and they're probably right.</p>

<h3 id="a000720">National Peanut Butter Lovers Day</h3>

<p>Breean just told me that March 1st is National Peanut Butter Lovers Day. Apparently all of March is <a href="http://www.peanutbutterlovers.com/loversmonth/index.html">Peanut Butter Lovers Month</a>. Rock on.</p>
<p>Somehow I don't think I could possibly increase my peanut butter consumption at all though.</p>

<h2>March 02, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a000718">iPod me, baby</h3>

<p>So I've finally decided that I can't wait any longer. With some of my tax return money I'm going to get an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>. Woo-hoo! Don't tell Sallie Mae!<img src="2004/03/01/ipod_small.jpg" alt="iPod" height="144" width="213" align="right"/></p>
<p>But I can't decide what to say with the free engraving. <b>Any ideas?</b> Here's a few of the best Breean and I could come up with:
<blockquote>
iRock, therefore iAm<br/>
(my current fav)<br/>
<br/>
Ithaca is Gorges<br/>
(<a href="http://www.ilovenyphotos.com/ithgorges/ithgorges.html">local flavor</a>)<br/>
<br/>
The sun'll still shine<br/>
But the night is on my mind<br/>
(from a Tribe Called Quest song)<br/>
<br/>
2 legit! 2 legit!<br/>
2 legit 2 quit!<br/>
(mc hammer)<br/>
<br/>
I fought the law<br/>
and the law won<br/>
(learned the song from my 3rd grade teacher)<br/>
<br/>
Party all the time!<br/>
Party all the time!<br/>
(Breean's favorite)
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a000717">More from Bush News</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.glocom.org/opinions/essays/20040301_tsurumi_president/index.html">President George Bush and the Gilded Age</a> [from <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/">0xDECAFBAD</a>]:
<blockquote>
During the last economic recovery period of March 1991 to April 1993, a 10% increase in GDP increased manufacturing jobs and service jobs 3% and 5.9% respectively. However, for the present economic recovery since November 2001, a 10% increase in GDP is increasing manufacturing and service jobs only 0.7% and 0.9% respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Just to keep up with her population growth, the U.S. needs to create about 230,000 jobs a month. If the U.S. wants to employ the 3 million unemployed workers thrown out of work under the Bush Administration, the U.S. would have to create a lot more jobs monthly. Last month, however, the U.S. only created 115,000 jobs. President Bush has now abandoned his earlier declared promise of "creating 2.6 million jobs by the fall of 2004."<br/>
...<br/>
At Harvard Business School, thirty years ago, George Bush was a student of mine. I still vividly remember him. In my class, he declared that "people are poor because they are lazy." He was opposed to labor unions, social security, environmental protection, Medicare, and public schools.<br/>
<br/>
To him, the antitrust watch dog, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities Exchange Commission were unnecessary hindrances to "free market competition." To him, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was "socialism."
