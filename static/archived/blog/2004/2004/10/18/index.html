<h3 id="a000997">More on Bush the zealot</h3>

<p>Still reading that Bush article below. This is really scary stuff and I encourage you to make it all the way through.
<blockquote>
Every few months, a report surfaces of the president using strikingly Messianic language, only to be dismissed by the White House. Three months ago, for instance, in a private meeting with Amish farmers in Lancaster County, Pa., Bush was reported to have said, ''<b>I trust God speaks through me</b>.'' In this ongoing game of winks and nods, a White House spokesman denied the president had specifically spoken those words, but noted that ''his faith helps him in his service to people.''

<h3 id="a000996">Bush the zealot</h3>

<p>Scary NY Times Magazine <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?ex=1255579200&en=e49583a226477b67&ei=5090&partner=your-registration-system-sucks">article on Bush</a> [from <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>]:
<blockquote>
"In the summer of 2002, after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House didn't like about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior adviser to Bush. He expressed the White House's displeasure, and then he told me something that at the time I didn't fully comprehend -- but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.<br/>
<br/>
The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'"
