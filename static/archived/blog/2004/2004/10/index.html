<h3 id="a001025">Kerry now leading polls</h3>

<p>Electoral Vote Predictor 2004: <a href="http://electoral-vote.com/">Kerry 283 Bush 246</a>
<blockquote>
The lead has changed in five states, and all five changes favor Kerry. As a result, Kerry has now passed Bush in the electoral college. If today's results are the final results Wednesday morning, John Kerry will be elected as the 44th President of the United States, with 283 votes in the electoral college to George Bush's 246. But don't count on it. Many of Kerry's leads are razor thin. Counting only the strong + weak states, Bush leads 229 to 196, with 113 electoral votes in the tossup category Kerry's leads in the tossup states mean little to nothing. The turnout Tuesday will determine who wins.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a001024">Small business survival rates (again)</h3>

<p>My dad wanted to know survival rates for a company's first five years. The best data I could find comes from David Birch, who seems to be relatively <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19890101/5491.html">respectable</a>. This is originally from <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/columnist/abrams/2004-05-06-success_x.htm">USAToday.com</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="New business survival rate" src="http://sam.tingleff.com/cms/2004/10/30/smb_survival_rate.jpg" width="380" height="236" /></p>
<p>So the five-year survival rate is about 50%.</p>

<h3 id="a001021">Challenging an old assumption</h3>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/pubs/ek00/small.htm">U.S. Department of Labor</a> [through the <a href="http://www.business-opportunities.biz/">biz opportunities blog</a>]:
<blockquote>
Although many people believe that 80 percent of all small businesses fail within five years, statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal a different story. The Census Bureau reports that 76 percent of all small businesses operating in 1992 were still in business in 1996. In fact, only 17 percent of all small businesses that closed in 1997 were reported as bankruptcies or other failures. The other terminations occurred because the business was sold or incorporated or when the owner retired.

<p>We saw John Cleese speak at Cornell last night. He's a professor-at-large at the school, which is an honorary title they give to celebrities for a six-year term. Cleese has appartently been so successful at it that the school has extended his term by two years.</p>
<p>He spoke about religion, building a case from other sources, his own experience, and scenes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/">Life of Brian</a>; that organized religion is essentially a tool of control. it was both funny and very inciteful. At the end he plugged <a href="http://www.thejohncleese.com/">a new web site</a> to be released on his 65th birthday on the 27th.</p>

<h3 id="a000997">More on Bush the zealot</h3>

<p>Still reading that Bush article below. This is really scary stuff and I encourage you to make it all the way through.
<blockquote>
Every few months, a report surfaces of the president using strikingly Messianic language, only to be dismissed by the White House. Three months ago, for instance, in a private meeting with Amish farmers in Lancaster County, Pa., Bush was reported to have said, ''<b>I trust God speaks through me</b>.'' In this ongoing game of winks and nods, a White House spokesman denied the president had specifically spoken those words, but noted that ''his faith helps him in his service to people.''

<blockquote>
"In the summer of 2002, after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House didn't like about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior adviser to Bush. He expressed the White House's displeasure, and then he told me something that at the time I didn't fully comprehend -- but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.<br/>
<br/>
The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'"

<p>If you've wondered why I have a "Boycott Monsanto" link on the right side, this is a great example: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/13/monsanto_stole_paten.html">Monsanto stole patented wheat from Indian farmers</a>:
<blockquote>
The European Patent office in Munich had granted a patent to Monsanto on May 21, 2003. The patent covered wheat exhibiting a special baking quality that Monsanto claimed to be its invention.<br/>
<br/>
However, Greenpeace proved in its opposition that the wheat variety was bred by Indian farmers for improving its baking quality and it was not a genetically-engineered invention as claimed by Monsanto.

<h3 id="a000982">B-School profs against Bush</h3>

<p>Business Week: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf2004108_4276_db016.htm">For Bush, a Blast from the Ivory Tower</a>:
<blockquote>
George Bush, America's first President with an MBA, has been slapped on the knuckles by 169 concerned business-school professors. In an open letter sent on Oct. 4, the senior business and economics professors say Bush's economic policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. The academics, including two Nobel laureates, are especially critical of the budget deficit, which this year is projected to come in at more than $400 billion.<br/>
<br/>
The unkindest cut of all: The idea for the letter began in the faculty offices of Harvard Business School, where Bush earned his diploma in 1975.

<h3 id="a000980">Debate tonight</h3>

<p>Watching the debate now.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I think I've heard enough about terrorism and homeland security. I get the point guys, move on.</p>
<p>I don't like how Bush interrupts the moderator. It's disrespectful.</p>
<p>Okay, finally "health issues" (9:38 pm).</p>
<p>Bush: drugs from Canada will kill you.</p>
<p>Kerry: I'm fighting to get those drugs to you.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Finally someone calls Kerry on choosing Edwards even though he's a lawyer making $$$ off of <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2004/08/02/gvl10802.htm">silly lawsuits</a>. Kerry doesn't answer the question.</p>
<p>Bush: federal government going to run Kerry's "liberal" health care plan. Would "ruin the quality of health care in America." <i>I don't see what this has to do with the question, or Kerry's non-answer.</i></p>
<p>Okay, I get this point now. Kerry: rich get tax cuts. Bush: tax cuts get us out of recessions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Question from the moderator on the budget deficit. Both have promised to reduce the deficit by half in four years. How? Good question.</p>
<p>Bush: "because we cut taxes on everybody" the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history. <i>Does that answer the question?</i></p>
<p>Kerry: large corps are Bush's priority, you (audience) are my priority. <i>Doesn't seem to answer the question either</i>.</p>
<p><i>These guys make me mad. Why do they bother with this town-hall question format if they don't listen to the questions? Do they not think we're smart enough to notice?</i></p>

<h3 id="a000973">More on the debate</h3>

<p>This is for you Penni: supposedly Kerry now <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/">leads 47% to 43%</a> in the Newsweek poll. [from <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/10/my_election_das_1.html">A VC</a>]
<blockquote>
That is shocking to me and must mean that this 5-10% of the electorate that keeps moving around is on the fence and remains very much up for grabs.
</blockquote>
Apparently there are swing voters in this election. And apparently they either watch the debates or pay some attention to the press.

<h2>October 01, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a000968">Da Ali G Show</h3>

<p>We've been watching the season one dvd of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/alig/">Da Ali G Show</a> from Netflix. I cannot believe how funny it is.</p>
<p>The Sopranos, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/">Curb</a> and Ali G (Breean would add Six Feet Under) make you wonder why we even have network television any more. HBO these days makes a very compelling case that network television has a dying business model based on crappy content and crappy advertising.</p>

<h3 id="a000966">Bush - Kerry debate last night</h3>

<p>We watched <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/01/debates/">the debate</a> at Breean's theater on campus last night. It was a lot of fun to watch with a large group of people - and by people I mean students who seemed to generally agree with my own politics. Watching with a large group of right-wing religious fanatics would have been a whole different experience that no doubt I would never describe as "fun."</p>
<p>First off, I had difficulty watching Bush without thinking of the <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com/">Bush or Chimp?</a> web site. And Kerry needs to do something about his <a href="http://www.happyfunpundit.com/hfp/archives/000431.html">helmet hair</a>.</p>
<p>Do these debates every actually sway anybody? Naturally I thought Bush seemed immature and stoopid, but I am of course predisposed to think that way. I'm sure if you went in thinking Kerry is a flip-flopping liberal aristocrat, last night wouldn't change a thing.</p>
<p>Does the mythical "swing voter" exist anymore? And were they watching last night? What did they think?</p>
