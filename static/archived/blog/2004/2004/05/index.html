<p>Since when does Karl Malone <i>play for the Lakers</i>? Just another reason to hope they lose, I guess.</p>

<h3 id="a000873">Back to the bay</h3>

<p>Flew in to San Fransisco last night. Lots of fun...</p>
<p>I was flying out of Syracuse so we rented a car to stop at the Waterloo outlet mall on the way. 10 minutes after Breean drops me off at the airport I realize that my wallet is still in the rental car. Call Breean but her phone is turned off. Thank god I had my passport and could board the plane. No money, no lunch.</p>
<p>Land at LaGuardia in nyc and find out my flight to Chicago was cancelled. The oh so friendly (not) United clerk tells me that there's a direct flight to SFO leaving at 5:50. Great! But it flies out of JFK, and oh yeah you'll have to pay for transportation. I explain the wallet situation. He leaves to converse with someone, comes back with a voucher for the bus to Kennedy. Awesome!</p>
<p>Arrive at JFK at 4:40, not having eaten since 8 am. Dig through my backpack and find five British pounds and 10 Swiss francs along with my passport. Also some <a href="http://users.mrl.uiuc.edu/petrov/pari.html">Bulgarian leva</a> but the exchange counter guy doesn't seem to like that. Lunch, finally! Ended up arriving at SFO one hour earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Now at my Berkeley summer sublet. It's a three bedroom apartment at College and Derby, close to Shattuck and Ashby. There's a park almost right across the street and Andronico's is about three blocks away. Mmmm... Andronico's.</p>

<h3 id="a000870">Wal-Mart News Again</h3>

<p>WSJ.com: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB108552881179821388,00.html?mod=home%5Fpage%5Fone%5Fus">Big Retailers Face Overtime Suits As Bosses Do More 'Hourly' Work</a> [sub req'd]:
<blockquote>
Some of the nation's biggest and most cost-sensitive retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., RadioShack Corp. and Dollar General Corp., are battling a raft of lawsuits accusing them of using low-level managers to do the work of regular employees, in order to avoid paying overtime.<br/>
<br/>
Wal-Mart, a retailing giant with about 3,500 stores and 1.2 million workers in the U.S., and a well-known focus on lean margins, already faces 30 overtime-related suits on behalf of hourly workers in 28 states. Assistant managers who filed suit in Michigan and California, seeking back pay and damages say they spend much of their days on the same tasks assigned to hourly employees entitled to overtime.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>It's obvious at this point that Wal-Mart has a corporate culture devoted to low costs no matter the... costs.</p>

<h3 id="a000864">Cellular directory</h3>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=2026&e=1&u=/latimests/comingsoonacellphonedirectory">Coming Soon: A Cellphone Directory</a>:
<blockquote>
After years of anonymity, the numbers of most of the nation's mobile phones will be compiled later this year in the first wireless directory.<br/>
...<br/>
 It's also a big money issue for an industry suffering through brutal price wars. A wireless directory could generate as much as $3 billion a year in fees and additional minutes by 2009, according to a study conducted by consulting firm Zelos Group Inc.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Can you think of <i>anything</i> the industry could do that would anger customers more? Wait - don't answer that... these are cellular carriers we're talking about.</p>
<p>At least our trusted leadership is on the case:
<blockquote>
"I don't want the world to know my cellphone number," said Rep. Joseph R. Pitts (R-Pa.), who has introduced a bill to prevent wireless phone companies from automatically including customers in the directory without getting their permission and from charging customers if they want unlisted numbers.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>I'm tired of Big Co's making money off of my personal info. 5% of the value of cell phones is that Linda Cooper the-robot-voice-that-used-to-call-our-house-back-in-the-dark-ages-when-we-had-a-land-line can't call me. Don't take that away.</p>

<h3 id="a000847">Say goodbye to the phone company</h3>

<p>In this day and age, could one get rid of local phone service? We're paying about $150 per month for internet access + two cell phones, do we really need the extra $25 to Verizon for a phone line we hardly ever use?</p>
<p>My first choice would be to switch to free pc-based services like <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> and (shameless plug) <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>, but somehow I doubt that the same people who insist on calling our home line rather than a cell phone (read: family) will start using these.</p>
<p>The best choice seems to be voice over ip service from <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> or <a href="http://www.packet8.net/">Packet8</a>. They'll send you a little box that plugs into your home network, and you plug any standard phone into that little box.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.vonage.com/identity/vonage/images/how_it_works.gif"/></p>
<p>Sometimes you can even keep your phone number. Calls to other subscribers of the same service are free and the low cost plans allow about 500 nationwide minutes for $15 - $20 per month.</p>
<p>Vonage claims that we can keep our current phone number - I'm going to look into it.</p>

<h3 id="a000840">Britney Spears - In The Zone</h3>

<p>Breean's not going to like this, but I have to say that I really like Britney's latest cd, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DD7LB/qid=1084122652/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-6999456-4253435">In The Zone</a>. I'm not a big fan of her earlier 'art' but this one has a great sound. I like the fifth track, Early Morning; the sixth track that's getting all the airplay (Breean really hates this one, haha), Toxic; and the 11th, Brave New Girl. Madonna's appearance on the first and last songs doesn't hurt.</p>

<h3 id="a000837">Global Warming's Bottom Line</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0504-02.htm">Global Warming's Bottom Line</a> (thanks mom!):
<blockquote>
JUST AS ENRON and other off-sheet accounting debacles spelled disaster for many US investors, evidence shows that global warming could do the same. Without aggressive action to reduce the financial risks that global warming poses for companies, trillions of dollars of Americans' investments, many of them controlled here in Boston, will be jeopardized.<br/>
...<br/>
Worldwide insurance claims for extreme weather events and disasters like drought and forest fires have jumped tenfold in the last 40 years, hitting $55 billion in 2002. So serious is this issue that the world's second-largest reinsurer, Swiss Re, is telling its corporate clients to come up with strategies for handling global warming or risk losing their liability coverage.
