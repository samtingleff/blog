<h3 id="a000939">419 bank scam</h3>

<p>From a promising email I received today:
<blockquote>
I work for Allied Irish Bank (AIB) here in Dublin,
Ireland. I am a relationship officer and one of my
biggest customers was Isam Mattar, a Lebanese, now
deceased. He had a fixed time deposit with my Bank
which has matured and remains unclaimed till now. It
runs into the value of 24 Million Euro.<br/>
...<br/>
We have decided that <b>your share shall be
30% while we shall take home 35% each</b>. Kindly take
note of this to avoid ant future dispute on how to
distribute the facility among us.
</blockquote>
My god, if you're going to scam me at least promise to give me 50% of the take. I wonder what the typical split offer is in this business...</p>

<h2>July 23, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a000935">I met Scoble at BlogOn 2004</h3>

<p>And I came within six inches of Craig from <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> fame. There's a summer highlight for you.</p>
<p>Today I'm at the <a href="http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2004/">BlogOn 2004</a> conference on a student scholarship. I'm here as <a href="http://brv.cornell.edu/">an investor</a>, blogger and shill for <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>.</p>
<p>But if I hear the damn word 'blog' one more time I'm going to run. Something about that word has always bugged me... This whole conference strikes me as a real in-crowd congratulatory "look at all the cool stuff we're doing, oh we're so great; we're going to revolutionize media - blah blah blah." A bunch of smart people focusing on problems that really don't matter all that much.</p>
<p>I think that's what bugs me about 'blog.' Like most jargon it seems designed to differentiate those who know and those who don't. And everybody here 'knows' and the tone of all the talk strikes me as self-congratulatory about knowing.</p>
<p>Early in the day someone even showed a video of short on-the-street interviews in NYC. They asked random people if they know "what blogging is." Most didn't of course, and the whole crowd laughed. Was the laughter at 'us' or 'them'? That was unclear.</p>
<p>Unlike any other conference I've ever been to, when I introduced myself as a Cornell student and intern I kept getting the same feeling, like they were making an instant judgement that I'm a nobody. Eyes would glaze over and their attention was long gone. Never had that experience before.</p>

<h2>July 21, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a000932">The buying funnel</h3>

<p>If you've been paying attention (don't worry if you haven't), you know that I learned all of three things in school last year (<a href="2003/11/13/index.html#000478">1</a>, <a href="2004/01/26/index.html#000651">2</a>, <a href="2004/05/13/index.html#000850">3</a>). I've learned a few things about startup marketing this summer and I'm going to begin sharing them now. First up, <i>the funnel</i>.</p>
<p><i>Always</i> know your buying funnel. The funnel is the process a customer goes through to actually buy something. For <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>, the process looks something like this (each stage could even be broken down further):
 <ol>
  <li>Hear about the product</li>
  <li>Visit the web site</li>
  <li>Register</li>
  <li>Install software</li>
  <li>Confirm registration</li>
  <li>Try software</li>
  <li>Buy service</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>If you know exactly how many people you lose at each stage you can 1) benchmark against industry norms, 2) benchmark against yourself over time and 3) better determine where to allocate resources.</p>
<p>Next up, <i>the power of low expectations</i>.</p>

You can bet that's going to be the best darn looking electronic monitoring bracelet you'll ever see.

<h3 id="a000925">Political marketing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nelson.monkey.org/~nelson/weblog/politics/election2004/pessimism.html">'Pessimism'</a> [from <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>]:
<blockquote>
By taking this single word "pessimism" and using it to characterize the Democracts, the Bush campaign brilliantly defuses any criticism of the Bush presidency. Even better, it shifts the blame to the opposition who is calling attention to the problems.
</blockquote>
Nobody can claim this is a new technique in politics.

<h3 id="a000923">Mystery of the Consul General's wife</h3>

<p>I'm having dinner tonight at the Norwegian consulate's house in San Francisco. How did that happen, you ask...</p>
<p>The class I'm taking this summer is 90% Norwegian students, most of whom found the program through the <a href="http://www.grunderskolen.no/content/view/full/86">Norwegian School of Entrepreneurship</a>. This school shares an office with the consulate and seems to have close ties with him.</p>
<p>The consulate generously offered to host the entire class for dinner tonight. The invitation says:
<blockquote>
The Consul General of Norway<br/>
Are-Jostein Norheim <strike>and Mrs. Susana Lactoo Norheim</strike><br/>
request the pleasure of the company of<br/>
...
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Just like that, with his wife's name crossed out. Why? What happened?</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> turns out his wife is just out of town. Crossing her name off the invitation still seems a little strange, no? Would Miss Manners approve?</p>
<p>The Consul General has a very nice house, btw.</p>

<h3 id="a000919">Banana republic, not the store</h3>

<p>Yet another sign that we live in a banana republic: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1512&e=3&u=/afp/us_vote_congress">US lawmakers request UN observers for November 2 presidential election</a>.
<blockquote>
Several members of the House of Representatives have requested the United Nations to send observers to monitor the November 2 US presidential election to avoid a contentious vote like in 2000, when the outcome was decided by Florida.<br/>
Recalling the long, drawn out process in the southern state, nine lawmakers, including four blacks and one Hispanic, sent a letter Thursday to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan asking that the international body "ensure free and fair elections in America," according to a statement issued by Texas representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who spearheaded the effort.
