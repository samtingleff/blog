<h2>July 23, 2004</h2>


<h3 id="a000935">I met Scoble at BlogOn 2004</h3>

<p>And I came within six inches of Craig from <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> fame. There's a summer highlight for you.</p>
<p>Today I'm at the <a href="http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2004/">BlogOn 2004</a> conference on a student scholarship. I'm here as <a href="http://brv.cornell.edu/">an investor</a>, blogger and shill for <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>.</p>
<p>But if I hear the damn word 'blog' one more time I'm going to run. Something about that word has always bugged me... This whole conference strikes me as a real in-crowd congratulatory "look at all the cool stuff we're doing, oh we're so great; we're going to revolutionize media - blah blah blah." A bunch of smart people focusing on problems that really don't matter all that much.</p>
<p>I think that's what bugs me about 'blog.' Like most jargon it seems designed to differentiate those who know and those who don't. And everybody here 'knows' and the tone of all the talk strikes me as self-congratulatory about knowing.</p>
<p>Early in the day someone even showed a video of short on-the-street interviews in NYC. They asked random people if they know "what blogging is." Most didn't of course, and the whole crowd laughed. Was the laughter at 'us' or 'them'? That was unclear.</p>
<p>Unlike any other conference I've ever been to, when I introduced myself as a Cornell student and intern I kept getting the same feeling, like they were making an instant judgement that I'm a nobody. Eyes would glaze over and their attention was long gone. Never had that experience before.</p>

<h3 id="a000934">Johnson School Camp $tart-Up</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/04/7.15.04/Camp_Start-Up.html">CU Johnson School's Camp $tart-Up program prepares high school girls for business careers</a>:
<blockquote>
Last week 28 young women, ages 12 to 18, came to campus to take part in this summer's Cornell Camp $tart-Up. They got to take classes in Sage Hall geared to high school-age girls on such business-related subjects as finance and accounting, operations and quality control, and sales and service; live in a residential house, Akwe:kon; and in their spare time, hang out where Cornell students on North Campus do, at the Robert Purcell Community Center.

<h3 id="a000933">17 days, 20 hours and 30 minutes</h3>

<p>I haven't slept more than six hours any day this week. It sucks. Between work and summer school there's just way too much on my mind.</p>
<p>Only two weeks to go <a href="http://samnbree.tingleff.com/">before Cancun</a>! We're hoping to get an email out in the next few days with some travel tips.</p>
