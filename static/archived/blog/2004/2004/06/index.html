<h3 id="a000916">It's a slippery slope to evil marketing guy</h3>

<p>I'm having some conflict with a 'guerilla marketing' person at work. She's a traditional marketing type and wants to collect all kinds of user information that I find invasive, like age/gender/income/occupation/etc. Marketers traditionally <i>love</i> this stuff.</p>
<p>Am I alone in objecting to surveying users for this kind of info? Personally I hate it when businesses ask for it and I think it hurts the long-term customer relationship. Breean thinks I'm just strange about privacy issues like this. Is that true?</p>

<blockquote>
The designated checkpoint won't open in Minneapolis for a couple of weeks, and only travelers who consider it their home airport will be able to use it. In turn, Minneapolis passengers won't get special access at the other airports.<br/>
<br/>
For the 90-day pilot period, the government is limiting participation to business flyers who are on the road at least once a week.

When does this go national?

<p><a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2004/06/28/index.html#000912">Breean won</a> and got a gmail address before me. I signed up tonight though, for allnet@gmail.com.</p>
<p>This is really ingenious marketing by google. By making it 'invitation only' half the internet has been trying to get an account. People even paid real money for them on eBay.</p>
<p>I also signed up for <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> today. I've run out of cell phone minutes this month and every extra minute I use before 9 pm Pacific costs 40&cent; each.</p>
<p>9 pm Pacific is of course midnight Eastern, way past Breean's bedtime. As the household telecom manager I need to investigate cheaper options. Skype is a free voice calling application that runs on your pc, supposedly the sound quality is better than normal telephones.</p>

<h3 id="a000911">Identity theft</h3>

<p>I think someone is stealing my identity.</p>
<p>I woke up early Saturday morning when the credit card company called to verify a few suspicious charges. Most were mine or Breean's but there was one at an Oakland gas station on Friday. I didn't go near Oakland on Friday. Cancel the card.</p>
<p>Now I'm worried.</p>

<p>Fahrenheit 9/11 is going to be huge. It's the most-requested movie on <a href="http://www.moviefone.com/">Moviefone.com</a> right now and yesterday morning I heard Howard Stern plugging it.

<p>It's trading at $53.82 on the <a href="http://www.hsx.com/">Hollywood Stock Exchange</a> right now, which predicts a weekend gross of $53.8m. It'll be interesting to see how close they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4906829/">Sorry Disney</a>,  you missed out.</p>
<p>I haven't seen it and after reading <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_06_24.html#007356">this review</a> for some perspective I probably won't.</p>

Popular low-carbohydrate diets are leading Americans to poor health and spawning a rip-off industry of "carb-friendly" products, health experts and consumer advocates said on Tuesday. They announced a new group, called the Partnership for Essential Nutrition, to help educate Americans about the need for healthy carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains.

A federal judge in San Francisco ruled that a gender-discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. could move forward as a class action, allowing the lawsuit to apply to as many as 1.6 million current and former female employees who worked for the company since Dec. 26, 1998.<br/>

Did the Pistons do to basketball what Billy Beene and the A's <a href="http://literati.net/Lewis/LewisBooks.htm">did to baseball</a> (read that book, btw)?</p>
<p>That is, rethink which player characteristics are truly necessary to win and buy those those players on the cheap from sucker teams. Their payroll this year is $52,942,639, or 14th in the league (Knicks are # 1 at $84.5m).</p>
<p>They don't have a single star on the team. Do they have a statistician on staff? I smell a Billy Beane...</p>

<blockquote>
 Rates on federal student loans have fallen to around 3 percent &#8212; a 35-year low. Even better, students can lock in those rates, potentially saving thousands of dollars by ensuring their payments won't increase even if interest rates do.<br/>
<br/>
But a proposal in Congress could shut down the party. The measure would end the fixed-rate option, making all federal student loans issued after July 2006 subject to variable rates. Repayments would then rise and fall each year in sync with interest rates.

(Some business schools have) launched new courses that encourage students to learn to collaborate with each other and work in teams; they offer executive coaching rather than just lecturing; they create ambitious new courses in leadership.
