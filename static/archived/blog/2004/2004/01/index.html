<p>Chatting with the parents tonight over Yahoo! with the webcams. They have technical difficulties all the time but it seems to work great here. Video/voice quality sucks but the price is right.</p>
<p>Now we have to get Meagan a webcam so we can argue face-to-face.</p>

Official Wants to Replace 'Evolution'</a>: "The state's school superintendent has proposed striking the word evolution from Georgia's science curriculum and replacing it with the phrase "biological changes over time."</p>
<p>Remind me to never move to Georgia. Thanks. Oh yeah, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi and Oklahoma are on the list too cause they've already taken out all references to evolution in the school curriculum. Watch for long-term harm to their economies.</p>

<h3 id="a000667">Another week on The Apprentice</h3>

<p>The task this week was to run Planet Hollywood in Times Square for one night.</p>
<p>Troy showed pure genius tonight. Selling autographs of Kwame Jackson (who's he? nobody) was an inspiration. "I'm Kwame Jackson, from Charlotte, North Carolina." That's marketing.</p>
<p>The men showed a real lack of understanding, while the women caught on pretty quickly that revenue and margins in the restaurant business come from alcoholic drinks. The women <i>won again</i>!</p>
<p>And if this isn't the pot calling the kettle black, I don't know what is: The Donald <i>scolded the women for relying too much on sex appeal</i>.</p>
<p>Bowie was eliminated for poor performance running merchandise. Maybe that was justified but Nick was a real downer and hardly contributed at all. I'm glad Kwame is still around, I like his chances right now.</p>
<p>Reshuffling of the teams next week! Finally.</p>

<h3 id="a000656">Bad luck</h3>

<p>My schedule this semester is exactly opposite all the other basketball players at Johnson. When they want to play (Tues, Thurs mornings), I have class; when I want to play (Wed, Fri mornings) everybody else seems to have class. <i>D'oh!</i></p>
<p>Believe me, if it was possible at all we would have coordinated things somehow. But as a first-year in an <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/academic/courses_arch/ci_plan.html">immersion</a> I have little choice in my schedule.</p>

<h3 id="a000655">Hooked on sugar</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0125-01.htm">Overweight America is Hooked on Sugar</a> (thanks mom):
<blockquote>
The U.S. secretary of health actually claims, in the face of a mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary, that it's fine to get 25% of one's calories from refined sugar!<br/>
<br/>
The real reason for the administration's preposterous position is that the powerful U.S. sugar industry is one of its biggest financial backers, and a major power in the key electoral state of Florida. The sugar industry is also one of Washington's most successful lobby groups and a huge contributor to congressmen and senators of both parties.<br/>
<br/>
The result: the federal government subsidizes U.S. sugar producers to the tune of $1.4 billion US annually. Import restrictions protect them from foreign competition and keep domestic sugar prices three or four times higher than world prices. Sugar remains the nation's most heavily subsidized crop at almost $500 per acre per annum.

<p>This week's Business Week provides <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_05/b3868047.htm">three real-world lessons</a> from <i>The Apprentice</i>: "So, B-schoolers, close the books, sit back, and tune in. The show features some hard lessons you aren't likely to learn in those case studies on leadership:" I can assure you that this <i>is not</i> part of our curriculum. That's why I'm watching.</p>
<p><b>Reality # 1:</b> When push comes to shove, watch your back and look out for good old # 1.</p>
<p><b>Reality # 2:</b> "There's no such thing as bad publicity."</p>

<h3 id="a000649">Big Fish</h3>

<p>We saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/">Big Fish</a> at a matinee today on Penni's recommendation. It's a great story about fathers and the fish stories they tend to tell. The stories here are outlandish fairy tales but are always charming.</p>
<p>Naturally this movie made me think of my own dad. Why is it that dads like telling tales so much?</p>

<h3 id="a000642">B-school interview</h3>

<p>I had my first b-school job interview today. It wasn't all that different from interviews I've had in the past. I expected some complex financial puzzles or to be asked about the effect of political unrest in Albania on the six month spot rate. But no, just the same old b.s half hour behavioral interview.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes of their questions, then me asking questions I already know the answers to just to demonstrate my knowledge of the company. Supposedly this is the game.</p>
<p>I wish I interviewed better. I've been in the workforce since 2000 and I still don't feel at all confident interviewing. I know I'm not normally the most articulate person in the world but when interviewing I feel like a bumbling idiot.</p>

<h3 id="a000639">The Apprentice (again)</h3>

<p>This week both teams started with almost the same strategy. The guys chose Sam as their team leader to either win or get rid of him. The women chose Omarosa hoping to lose and get rid of her. Well, that's what my girl Amy wanted to do. The women chose Jessie as their leader.</p>
<p>The challenge this week was negotiation - to get the lowest price on a list of items including a gold bar and 5 lbs of squid.</p>
<p>The guys <i>lost for the third time in a row</i> and Trump said he may never hire a man again. Sam was the obvious choice to go. I felt for the guy.</p>

High daily doses of vitamins E and C taken together reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease among elderly people, a study said on Monday.  Taken in supplement form, and not in a lower-dose multivitamin, the vitamins' anti-oxidant properties appear to offset the buildup of so-called free radicals that are believed to damage cells and lead to the debilitating brain disease.

<blockquote>
For more than 15 years, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, has locked in overnight employees at some of its Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. It is a policy that many employees say has created disconcerting situations, such as when a worker in Indiana suffered a heart attack, when hurricanes hit in Florida and when workers' wives have gone into labor.<br/>
...<br/>
One night, shortly after closing time, Mr. Ellsworth had an asthma attack. "My inhaler hardly helped," he said. "I couldn't breathe. I felt I was going to pass out. I got fuzzy vision. I told the assistant manager I really needed to go to the hospital. He pretty much got in my face and told me not to leave or I'd get fired. I was having trouble standing. When I finally told him I was going to call a lawyer, he finally let me out."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>This is a company with a totally broken corporate culture and no respect for employees. I wonder how high in the executive suite this kind of attitude reaches.</p>

<h3 id="a000618">Apprentice update</h3>

<p>He fired Jason? For one bad decision, after everybody in the room agreed that all the men hate Sam? Jason's real mistake was to rat out Nick after the strong defense he (Nick) gave for Jason's leadership, but The Donald didn't fire him for that. Trump wants to keep Sam around just for the drama.</p>
<p>So far the women have made the men look like idiots. Hopefully when the men are down to about four people they'll start making better decisions and reacting a little faster.</p>
<p>I stand by my pick (<a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/contestants/about_amy.shtml">Amy</a>). She performed like a champ this week. I'm predicting <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/contestants/about_omarosa.shtml">Omarosa</a> to go next week. She's fighting with everybody.</p>

<h3 id="a000616">More wasted money</h3>

<p>Now Bush wants to <a href="http://www.kfdx.com/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&id=4208">spend $1.5 billion</a> on an "initiative to promote marriage." (?) Supposedly, "the money would go to provide training for couples to develop interpersonal skills that sustain 'healthy marriages.'"</p>
<p>Sounds like a sneaky way to spend government $$ on his campaign.</p>

<h3 id="a000610">Bush's space program</h3>

<p>Bush says <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040114-1.html">USA to return to the moon by 2015</a>, capitalizing on <a href="http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/spirit.html">pretty pictures from Mars</a> in an election year. Leaves future generations to foot the bill. At least Congress is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-01-14-congress-moon_x.htm">asking questions about the cash</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it the space program serves two goals. The first is to act as an employment program for highly skilled aerospace engineers. The second is to instill national pride and indicate strength to 'competitive' nations. An interplanetary spitting contest, you might call it.</p>
<p>But doesn't the national debt do the same thing, except for the employment program? A huge and growing debt signals a lack of economic strength to 'competitors' and partners alike. A national debt of <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">$23,919.62 per person</a> is embarrasing to the country and has negative psychological repurcussions for investors.</p>
<p>But there are no 'competitive' nations left, only partners (those who participate in the international economy and buy our debt) and rogue nations or isolated economies.</p>
<p>And as for all those aerospace engineers, personally I'd love to see a cheap, three-hour transatlantic flight. Talk about breathing life into the economy. Why aren't they working on that?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">MoveOn.org</a> Bush in 30 Seconds <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/">winners</a> are worth watching.

<p>As <a href="http://breean.tingleff.com/cms/2004/01/11/index.html#000587">Breean says</a> we had to wash dishes in the bathtub yesterday. Tonight we have no running water. Anywhere. In the entire house.</p>
<p>When we left tonight for a movie there was limited water pressure in the bathroom but no hot water. The landlord said that he would check it out tonight and see us tomorrow. What happened?</p>

<h3 id="a000593">21 Grams</h3>

<p>We saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733/">21 Grams</a> for the $5 Monday movie at Fall Creek Theater today. This is a movie in the genre best described by:
<ol>
 <li>People (men, mostly) screw up</li>
 <li>Bad things happen</li>
 <li>Some mildly redeeming event occurs</li>
</ol>
If you like that sort of thing (I don't) and you like being extremely depressed (I don't) you might like this movie (I didn't). Otherwise, run away as fast as you can.</p>

<h3 id="a000581">Gladwell on SUVs</h3>

<p>This week in the New Yorker <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/">Malcolm Gladwell</a> writes about SUVs. The full article seems not to be available online but there's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?online/040112on_onlineonly01">an interview</a> available with the gist of his argument: "You mention that people are more concerned with feeling safe than with being safe, and that this results in the popularity of limited-feedback, poorly performing vehicles like S.U.V.s."</p>
<p>Earlier I <a href="2003/12/18/index.html#000545">pointed to</a> an economic analysis of SUVs that claims they are a rational self-defense purchase. Gladwell says that SUVs are in fact <i>not</i> more safe for the driver, but provide the illusion of safety to our "reptilian" brains.</p>

<h3 id="a000577">The Apprentice</h3>

<p>We caught the first half hour of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/">The Apprentice</a> tonight. Breean thinks it'll be a big topic of discussion at school and wanted me to watch just to keep up.</p>
<p>The first task was totally unfair. Who's going to sell more lemonade on the streets of New York - <a href="">eight average looking men</a> or <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/teams/the_women.shtml">eight... better-looking women</a>, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/contestants/about_kristi.shtml">one of whom</a> has <a href="http://www.gawker.com/archives/kristi_franks_the_softcore_apprentice.php">acted in the past</a>?</p>
<p>We missed the end though. Who was eliminated tonight?</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye on the show, I thought it was more interesting than most of the other psuedo-reality shows on right now.</p>

<h3 id="a000567">On google</h3>

<p>I can't be the only one dissapointed that Google <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&sid=a_Eq9eQKlAas&refer=home">will go through Morgan and Goldman</a> for their IPO. Why not <a href="http://www.openipo.com/ind/index.html">OpenIPO</a>?</p>
<p>From an investment standpoint I'm not as excited as everybody else seems to be. Competition in the search space is <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/01/05/1839233.shtml?tid=126&tid=185&tid=95">always 'almost there'</a>, and going public will seriously challenge the Google <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google_pr.html">code of conduct</a> (long term, everything the company stands for). This is the internet ppl, nothing stays on top for long.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: bubblegeneration <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/2004_01_04_archives.cfm#107349359952470420">seems to agree</a> on both counts.</p>

<h3 id="a000566">TiVo marketing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/3/hubamac1.asp">How to Ignore Your Best Customers, the TiVo Way</a> [from <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">scripting news</a>]:
<blockquote>
Instead of capitalizing on its tens of thousands of customer evangelists to move the product into the mainstream, TiVo&rsquo;s word-of-mouth strategy focuses on celebrity endorsements and television show product placement. The problem: celebrity endorsements&#8212;even if they are unpaid in TiVo&rsquo;s case&#8212;are obscured by Hollywood&rsquo;s culture of fakery and PR puffery.
</blockquote>
In a marketing class discussion earlier this year it was generally said that TiVo's marketing problem is that the feature set is too difficult to explain to a mass audience (is it a VCR? what is it?). This points to a different problem - that TiVo relies on an outdated model of celebrity endorsements though these carry absolutely no weight with the core market.</p>
