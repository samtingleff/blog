<h3 id="a000682">Lazy students</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/feb2004/bs2004023_6821_bs001.htm">Internships: Never More Important</a>: "Once used mainly as a way for MBAs to get experience, they're now widely seen as the best way to get into a company that'll hire them:"</p>
<p>The real story is hidden in the middle:
<blockquote>
Investment banking and consulting no longer appear as exotic as they did in the boom years, when upwards of 80% of newly minted MBAs would head off to jobs in those specialties. Today, fewer than 60% of students will enter or return to such positions. The percentage drop is partly because fewer consulting and investment banking positions are available, but it's also because those jobs still require brutal work hours and the seven-figure bonuses that made them so lucrative are no longer a given.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>A professor today asked a class of about 70 students how many of us are workaholics or recovering workaholics. Maybe three people raised their hands. Sure this is a class on entrepreneurship and venture capital and not on i-banking, but I think there's a real trend here.</p>

<h3 id="a000681">More anti-Bush propaganda</h3>

<p>From that bastion of liberal thought, <i>Business Week</i>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/@@PEYkwGUQhRAxsQ4A/premium/content/04_06/b3869034_mz007.htm">Bush's Cynical Immigration Gambit</a> [sub req'd]: "Informed observers believe Bush does not really expect this legislation to pass. Rather, he wants to signal compassion to Mexican-American voters, many of whom have relatives here illegally, while appealing to corporations seeking low-wage workers."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_06/b3869035_mz005.htm">Hail To The King -- Er, Chief</a> [sub req'd]. Review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670032646/qid=1075864333/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7424962-9914336?v=glance&s=books">American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush</a> by <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/01/int04001.html">Kevin Phillips</a>:
<blockquote>
The former Nixon White House strategist, who 35 years ago, in The Emerging Republican Majority, correctly predicted a virtual Republican lock on the South, has a startling new thesis: The Bush family has systematically used four generations of old-boy networking, national security involvement, and political deception to establish an American family aristocracy of sorts.<br/>
...<br/>
Phillips gets right to the heart of why figures ranging from Ross Perot to Bob Dole, John McCain, George Soros, and most recently former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill all came to harbor a bitterness and distrust toward the Bushes. For behind their likable facade, he says, lies a "culture of secrecy, deceit, and disinformation [that] have become Bush political hallmarks."<br/>
...<br/>
From the 1890s right on through to the 1989 invasion of Panama, the Gulf War, and most recently the U.S. invasion of Iraq, no American family has "more fully epitomized and risen alongside the hundred-year emergence of the U.S. military-industrial complex," Phillips writes.

<h3 id="a000680">I've got a few suggestions</h3>

<p>My microecon professor Robert Frank is quoted in the NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/03/politics/campaign/03MEMO.html?ex=1391144400&en=cdacfbb0f942b8cc&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">on the Democratic primary</a>:
<blockquote>
As long as the money lasts, however, the urge is to persist, said Robert H. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell. "So they end up like Bruce Willis in `The Sixth Sense,' " Professor Frank said. "They're dead, but they don't know it yet."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Why did they talk to an econ professor? And why didn't they ask him the more interesting question of what better use to make of a dead candidate's money?</p>
