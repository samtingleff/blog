<h3 id="a000671">Cola Wars</h3>

<p>Okay mom (&amp; Randy), here's the cola paper. Mom, your one sentence paper pretty much hit the head on the nail (or something).</p>

<p>Concentrate producers in the carbonated soft drink (CSD) industry are more profitable than bottlers because they hold a lock on product value.  Though the raw materials for concentrate production are commodities - caramel coloring, other flavors and caffeine - the retail value of a can of Coke lies in the company’s long history and aggressive consumer marketing.  As the owner of that valuable Coke trademark, the Coca-Cola Company holds all of the cards in its relationships with bottlers.</p>

<p>Concentrate producers in the carbonated soft drink (CSD) industry are more profitable than bottlers because they hold a lock on product value.  Though the raw materials for concentrate production are commodities - caramel coloring, other flavors and caffeine - the retail value of a can of Coke lies in the company’s long history and aggressive consumer marketing.  As the owner of that valuable Coke trademark, the Coca-Cola Company holds all of the cards in its relationships with bottlers.</p>

<p>Concentrate producers face a wide choice in suppliers, as the raw materials for most colas are primarily commodity food products.</p>

<p>In addition to concentrate, raw materials for CSD bottlers include packaging and sweeteners.  Though packaging and sweeteners are generally thought of as commodities, bottlers are restricted to a single supplier for their most basic ingredient of concentrate.  Because of noncompete agreements and historical ties to concentrate producers, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) and Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) are each constrained to a single supplier for concentrate.  This limited flexibility inhibits their ability to bargain with concentrate suppliers for better pricing.</p>

<p>CCE and PBG serve a variety of retail channels, none of which constitute more than 35% of sales.  Customers of the bottlers may choose between Coke and Pepsi, to play them off of each other for greater savings.  In 1999 Burger King used such a strategy to achieve 23% rebates on each gallon of Coke syrup.</p>

<p>The consolidation initiated by Coke in 1980 produced a single bottler with 70% of North American volume by 2000.  By 2000 the Pepsi Bottling Group similarly owned outright half of Pepsi’s 200 North American bottlers and held equity positions in many of the others.  The result of this consolidation is that both Pepsi and Coke each have a single customer for much of their North American volume.  Though both bottlers are independent companies each maintains close ties to the parent concentrate producer, limiting freedom to select another supplier.  Though Coke and Pepsi each serve their largest market through a single customer, those customers have limited bargaining power.</p>

<p>Though monetary barriers to entry in both the bottling and concentrate production industries are $25 million at minimum, a new concentrate producer faces more significant challenges than a new bottler.  While an entrepreneurial bottler with unlimited funds could conceivably buy into the market, a new concentrate producer would be forced to spend far more with indeterminate results to challenge the powerful brand equity Coke and Pepsi have built over the last 100+ years.  Bottlers have little invested in their own brands.</p>

<p>The CSD industry clearly faces a huge variety of substitutes, from sports drinks to juices and iced teas.  With such a variety of substitutes, consumers of carbonated soft drinks are extremely price sensitive.  A shift in demand for Coke however, will affect both the concentrate producer and the bottler.</p>
