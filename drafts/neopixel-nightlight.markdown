### Goal

Install a strip of color changing LEDs in each bedroom in our house which will (1) act as a simple siri-controlled multicolor light; and (2) integrate into a smart home with functions such as
* slow fade on to wake the kids up on school days during the winter;
* communicate time and status in a simple way during critical business processes like "getting the fuck ready for school without constant reminders";
* disco mode for parties or special events;

The software side of all this was rather easy (don't get me wrong, it took forever) for me - I have a DIY home controller which knows things like "is today a school day" and "what time is sunrise". However I found the hardware side of this to be super interesting and a great learning experience.

The end result is lighting which performs all of the above functions and more. The kids like it and - I hope - it's made our wake up routine easier for everybody.

At some point I'd like to add a remote or some other self-service means of control. Siri on mom or dad's phone is a horrible UX for a kid who wants to turn on the lights.

Note that this assumes the Arduino IDE and that you have connected DIN to on the LED to pin TODO on the D1 mini.

It opens a server socket and listens for connections on port TODO. Usage is an exercise for the reader.
