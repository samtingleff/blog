### Goal

Install a strip of color changing LEDs in each child's room which will (1) act as a simple siri-controlled multicolor light; and (2) integrate into a smart home with functions such as
* slow fade on to wake the kids up on school days, when helpful during the winter;
* communicate time and status in a simple way during critical business processes like "getting the fuck ready for school without constant reminders";
* disco mode for parties or special events;

The software side of all this was rather easy for me - I have a DIY home controller which knows things like "is today a school day" and "what time is sunrise today". However I found the hardware side of this to be super interesting and a great learning experience.

The end result is a lighting experience which performs all of the above functions and more. The kids like it and - I hope - it's made our wake up routine easier for everybody.
